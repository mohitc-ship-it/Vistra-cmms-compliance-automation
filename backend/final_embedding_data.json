POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]6 Access control policies (e.g., identity- or role-based policies, control matrices, and cryptography) control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, and domains) in systems. Access enforcement mechanisms can be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security. Other systems include systems internal and external to the organization. This requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. The definition of and enforcement of access authorizations, other than those determined by account type (e.g., privileged verses [sic] non-privileged) are addressed in AC.L1-b.1.ii. FURTHER DISCUSSION Identify users, processes, and devices that are allowed to use company computers and can log on to the company network. Automated updates and other automatic processes should be associated with the user who initiated (authorized) the process. Limit the devices (e.g., printers) that can be accessed by company computers. Set up your system so that only authorized users, processes, and devices can access the company network. This requirement, AC.L1-b.1.i, controls system access based on user, process, or device identity. AC.L1-b.1.i leverages IA.L1-b.1.v which provides a vetted and trusted identity for access control. Example 1 Your company maintains a list of all personnel authorized to use company information systems [a]. This list is used to support identification and authentication activities conducted by IT when authorizing access to systems [a,d]. Example 2 A coworker wants to buy a new multi-function printer/scanner/fax device and make it available on the company network. You explain that the company controls system and device access to the network, and will prevent network access by unauthorized systems and devices [c]. You help the coworker submit a ticket that asks for the printer to be granted access to the network, and appropriate leadership approves the device [f]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is a list of authorized users maintained that defines their identities and roles [a]? 6 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p.10 AC.L1-b.1.i \u2013 Authorized Access Control [FCI Data] CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 1 | Version 2.13 14 \u2022 Are account requests authorized before system access is granted [d,e,f]?",

Example You supervise the team that manages DoD contracts for your company. Members of your team need to access the contract information to perform their work properly. Because some of that data contains FCI, you work with IT to set up your group\u2019s systems so that users can be assigned access based on their specific roles [a]. Each role limits whether an employee has read-access or create/read/delete/update -access [b]. Implementing this access control restricts access to FCI information unless specifically authorized.

SPRS score: 1.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]16 Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and between systems (versus who can access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include the following: keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the internet; blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization; restricting requests to the internet that are not from the internal web proxy server; and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. 15 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 10. 16 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 11. AC.L2-3.1.3 \u2013 Control CUI Flow CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 20 Organizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on characteristics of the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Transferring information between systems representing different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of security requirements associated with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers and may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. NIST SP 800-41 provides guidance on firewalls and firewall policy. SP 800-125B provides guidance on security for virtualization technologies. In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes: prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels. FURTHER DISCUSSION Typically, companies will have a firewall between the internal network and the internet. Often multiple firewalls or routing switches are used inside a network to create zones to separate sensitive data, business units, or user groups. Proxy servers can be used to break the connection between multiple networks. All traffic entering or leaving a network is intercepted by the proxy, preventing direct access between networks. Companies should also ensure by policy and enforcement mechanisms that all CUI allowed to flow across the internet is encrypted. Example 1 You configure a proxy device on your company\u2019s network. CUI is stored within this environment. Your goal is to better mask and protect the devices inside the network while enforcing information flow policies. After the device is configured, information does not flow AC.L2-3.1.3 \u2013 Control CUI Flow CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 21 directly from the internal network to the internet. The proxy device intercepts the traffic and analyzes it to determine if the traffic conforms to organization information flow control policies. If it does, the device allows the information to pass to its destination [b]. The proxy blocks traffic that does not meet policy requirements [e]. Example 2 As a subcontractor on a DoD contract, your organization sometimes needs to transmit CUI to the prime contractor. You create a policy document that specifies who is allowed to transmit CUI and that such transmission requires manager approval [a,c,d]. The policy instructs users to encrypt any CUI transmitted via email or to use a designated secure file sharing utility [b,d]. The policy states that users who do not follow appropriate procedures may be subject to disciplinary action [e]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are designated sources of regulated data identified within the system (e.g., internal network and IP address) and between interconnected systems (e.g., external networks, IP addresses, ports, and protocols) [c]? \u2022 Are designated destinations of regulated data identified within the system (e.g., internal network and IP address) and between interconnected systems (external networks and IP addresses) [c]? \u2022 Are authorizations defined for each source and destination within the system and between interconnected systems (e.g., allow or deny rules for each combination of source and destination) [d]? \u2022 Are approved authorizations for controlling the flow of regulated data enforced within the system and between interconnected systems (e.g., traffic between authorized sources and destinations is allowed and traffic between unauthorized sources and destinations is denied) [e]?",

Separation of duties includes dividing mission functions and system support functions among different individuals or roles; conducting system support functions with different individuals (e.g., configuration management, quality assurance and testing, system management, programming, and network security); and ensuring that security personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions. Because separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations consider the entirety of organizational systems and system components when developing policy on separation of duties. 17 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 10. 18 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 11. AC.L2-3.1.4 \u2013 Separation of Duties CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 23 FURTHER DISCUSSION No one person should be in charge of an entire critical task from beginning to end. Documenting and dividing elements of important duties and tasks between employees reduces intentional or unintentional execution of malicious activities. Example 1 You are responsible for the management of several key systems within your organization including some that process CUI. You assign the task of reviewing the system logs to two different people. This way, no one person is solely responsible for the execution of this critical security function [c]. Example 2 You are a system administrator. Human Resources notifies you of a new hire, and you create an account with general privileges, but you are not allowed to grant access to systems that contain CUI [a,b]. The program manager contacts the team in your organization that has system administration authority over the CUI systems and informs them which CUI the new hire will need to access. Subsequently, a second system administrator grants access privileges to the new hire [c]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Does system documentation identify the system functions or processes that require separation of duties (e.g., function combinations that represent a conflict of interest or an over-allocation of security privilege for one individual) [a]?",

Assessment objective (3.1.5[d]): access to security functions is authorized in accordance with the principle of least privilege.. POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 3.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]20 Organizations employ the principle of least privilege for specific duties and authorized accesses for users and processes. The principle of least privilege is applied with the goal of authorized privileges no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions or business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and system accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems. Security functions include establishing system accounts, setting events to be logged, setting intrusion detection parameters, and configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges). Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from having access to privileged information or functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of this requirement between allowed privileges for local accounts and for domain accounts provided organizations retain the ability to control system configurations for key security parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk. FURTHER DISCUSSION The principle of least privilege applies to all users and processes on all systems, but it is critical to systems containing or accessing CUI. Least privilege: \u2022 restricts user access to only the machines and information needed to fulfill job responsibilities; and \u2022 limits what system configuration settings users can change, only allowing individuals with a business need to change them. Example You create accounts for an organization that processes CUI. By default, everyone is assigned a basic user role, which prevents a user from modifying system configurations. Privileged access is only assigned to users and processes that require it to carry out job functions, such as IT staff, and is very selectively granted [b,d]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are privileged accounts documented and is when they may be used defined [a]? \u2022 Are users assigned privileged accounts to perform their job functions only when it is necessary [b]? \u2022 Are necessary security functions identified (e.g., access control configuration, system configuration settings, or privileged account lists) that must be managed through the use of privileged accounts [c]? 20 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 12.

The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement access control policies such as role-based access control and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non- privileged account.

Tasks (including unauthorized tasks orchestrated by attackers) performed when using the privileged account can have a greater impact on the 21 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 11. 22 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 12.

Example You are logged in using your privileged account and you need to look up how to reset a non- functioning application which processes CUI. You should log on to another computer with your non-privileged account before you connect to the web and start searching for the reset information [b].

SPRS score: 1.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]24 Privileged functions include establishing system accounts, performing system integrity checks, conducting patching operations, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection 23 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 12. 24 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 12. AC.L2-3.1.7 \u2013 Privileged Functions CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 30 from non-privileged users. Note that this requirement represents a condition to be achieved by the definition of authorized privileges in 3.1.2 (AC.L2-3.1.2). Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Logging the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat. FURTHER DISCUSSION Non-privileged users should receive only those permissions required to perform their basic job functions. Privileged users are granted additional permissions because their jobs require them. Privileged functions typically involve the control, monitoring, or administration of the system and its security measures. When these special privileged functions are performed, the activity must be captured in an audit log, which can be used to identify abuse. Non- privileged employees must not be granted permission to perform any of the functions of a privileged user. This requirement, AC.L2-3.1.7, manages non-privileged users by logging any attempts to execute privileged functions. AC.L2-3.1.7 leverages AU.L2-3.3.2, which ensures logging and traceability of user actions. AC.L2-3.1.7 also extends AC.L2-3.1.2, which defines a requirement to limit types of transactions and functions to those that authorized users are permitted to execute. Example Your organization handles CUI and has put security controls in place that prevent non- privileged users from performing privileged activities [a,b,c]. However, a standard user was accidentally given elevated system administrator privileges. The organization has implemented an endpoint detection and response solution that provides visibility into the use of privileged activities. The monitoring system logs a security misconfiguration because the use of administrative privileges was performed by a user who was not known to have that ability. This allows you to correct the error [d]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is it possible to identify who enabled privileges at any particular time [d]? \u2022 Are the privileged system functions documented (e.g., functions that involve the control, monitoring or administration of the system, including security functions and log management) [a]? \u2022 Do documented procedures describe the configuration of the system to ensure system roles do not grant non-privileged users the ability to execute privileged functions [c]? \u2022 Do procedures describe the configuration of system settings to capture the execution of all privileged functions in audit logs [d]?

Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by systems are, in most cases, temporary and automatically release after a predetermined period established by the organization (i.e., a delay algorithm). If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ different algorithms for different system components based on the capabilities of the respective components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating system and application levels. FURTHER DISCUSSION Consecutive unsuccessful logon attempts may indicate malicious activity. OSAs can mitigate these attacks by limiting the number of unsuccessful logon attempts, typically by locking the account. A defined number of consecutive unsuccessful logon attempts is a common 25 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 12. 26 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 12-13. AC.L2-3.1.8 \u2013 Unsuccessful Logon Attempts CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 33 configuration setting. OSAs are expected to set this number at a level that fits their risk profile with the knowledge that fewer unsuccessful attempts provide higher security. After an unsuccessful login attempt threshold is exceeded and the system locks an account, the account may either remain locked until an administrator takes action to unlock it, or it may be locked for a predefined time after which it unlocks automatically. Example You attempt to log on to your work computer, which stores CUI. You mistype your password three times in a row, and an error message is generated telling you the account is locked [b]. You call your IT help desk or system administrator to request assistance. The system administrator explains that the account is locked as a result of three unsuccessful logon attempts [a]. The administrator offers to unlock the account and notes that you can wait 30 minutes for the account to unlock automatically. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is there a defined threshold for the number of unsuccessful logon attempts for which the system takes action to prevent additional attempts [a]? \u2022 Is a mechanism for limiting the number of unsuccessful logon attempts implemented and does it use the defined threshold [b]?",

Based on a risk assessment, organizations consider whether a secondary system use notification is needed to access applications or other system resources after the initial network logon.

AC.L2-3.1.9 \u2013 Privacy & Security Notices CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 35 FURTHER DISCUSSION Every system containing or providing access to CUI has legal requirements concerning user privacy and security notices. One method of addressing this requirement is the use of a system-use notification banner that displays the legal requirements of using the system. Users may be required to click to agree to the displayed requirements of using the system each time they log on to the machine. This agreement can be used in the civil and/or criminal prosecution of an attacker that violates the terms. The legal notification should meet all applicable requirements. At a minimum, the notice should inform the user that: \u2022 information system usage may be monitored or recorded, and is subject to audit; \u2022 unauthorized use of the information systems is prohibited; \u2022 unauthorized use is subject to criminal and civil penalties; \u2022 use of the information system affirms consent to monitoring and recording; \u2022 the information system contains CUI with specific requirements imposed by the Department of Defense; and \u2022 use of the information system may be subject to other specified requirements associated with certain types of CUI such as Export Controlled information. Example You are setting up IT equipment including a database server that will contain CUI. You have worked with legal counsel to draft a notification. It contains both general and specific CUI security and privacy requirements [a]. The system displays the required security and privacy information before anyone logs on to your organization\u2019s computers that contain or provide access to CUI [b]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are objectives identified for privacy and security notices, and does the implementation satisfy the required objectives [a,b]?

Session locks are implemented where session activities can be determined, typically at the operating system level (but can also be at the application level). Session locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of the system, for example, if organizations require users to log out at the end of the workday. Pattern-hiding displays can include static or dynamic images, for example, patterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, clock, battery life indicator, or a blank 29 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 13. 30 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 13.

FURTHER DISCUSSION Session locks can be initiated by the user or, more fundamentally, enabled automatically when the system has been idle for a period of time, for example, five minutes. Session locks are a quick way to prevent unauthorized use of the systems without having a user log off. Minimum configuration requirements are left up to the organization to define. A locked session shows pattern-hiding information on the screen to mask the data on the display. Example You manage systems for an organization that stores, processes, and transmits CUI. You notice that employees leave their offices without locking their computers. Sometimes their screens display sensitive company information. You configure all machines to lock after five minutes of inactivity [a,b]. You also remind your coworkers to lock their systems when they walk away [a]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Does the session lock hide previously visible information (e.g., replacing what was visible with a lock screen or screensaver that does not include sensitive information) [c]? \u2022 If session locks are not managed centrally, how are all computer users made aware of the requirements and how to configure them [a,b,c]?",

SPRS score: 1.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]32 This requirement addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., disconnecting from the network). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user\u2019s logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on system use. 31 NIST SP 800-171A, pp. 13-14. 32 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 13. AC.L2-3.1.11 \u2013 Session Termination CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 39 FURTHER DISCUSSION Configure the system to terminate user sessions based on the organization\u2019s policy. Session termination policies can be simple or sophisticated. Examples are inactivity (end the session after a specified duration (e.g., one hour33) of inactivity), day/time (all sessions are terminated at the end of the established workday), misbehavior (end the session due to an attempted policy violation), and maintenance (terminate sessions to prevent issues with an upgrade or service outage). If there is no automatic control of user sessions, an attacker can take advantage of an unattended session. Example 1 You manage systems containing CUI for your organization and configure the system to terminate all user sessions after 1 hour of inactivity [a]. As the session timeout approaches, the system prompts users with a warning banner asking if they want to continue the session. When the session timeout does occur, the login page pops up, and the users must log in to start a new session [b]. Example 2 A user is logged into a corporate database containing CUI but is not authorized to view CUI. The user has submitted a series of queries that unintentionally violate policy, as they attempt to extract CUI that the user is not authorized to view [a]. The session terminates with a warning as a result of a violation of corporate policy [b]. The user must reestablish the session before being able to submit additional legitimate queries. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are the conditions in which a user session must be terminated described (e.g., after a period of inactivity or after a defined time limit) [a]? \u2022 Are procedures documented that describe how to configure the system to enable automatic termination of user sessions after any of the defined conditions occur [b]? \u2022 Are user sessions terminated based on organization-defined conditions [a,b]?",

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]35 Remote access is access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks (e.g., the internet). Remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate control (e.g., employing encryption techniques for confidentiality protection), may provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. 34 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 14. 35 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 13-14. AC.L2-3.1.12 \u2013 Control Remote Access CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 41 Automated monitoring and control of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyber-attacks and help to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote users on a variety of system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smart phones, and tablets). NIST SP 800-46, SP 800-77, and SP 800-113 provide guidance on secure remote access and virtual private networks. FURTHER DISCUSSION Remote access connections pass through untrusted networks and therefore require proper security controls such as encryption to ensure data confidentiality. Initialization of all remote sessions should ensure that only authorized users and devices are connecting. After the remote session is established, the connection is monitored to track who is accessing the network remotely and what files are being accessed during the session. Remote access sessions can encompass more than just remote connections back to a headquarters network. Access to cloud-based email providers or server infrastructures also are relevant to this requirement if those environments contain CUI. This requirement, AC.L2-3.1.12, requires the control of remote access sessions and complements five other requirements dealing with remote access (AC.L2-3.1.14, AC.L2- 3.1.13, AC.L2-3.1.15, IA.L2-3.5.3, and MA.L2-3.7.5): \u2022 AC.L2-3.1.14 limits remote access to specific access control points. \u2022 AC.L2-3.1.13 requires the use of cryptographic mechanisms when enabling remote sessions. \u2022 AC.L2-3.1.15 requires authorization for privileged commands executed during a remote session. \u2022 IA.L2-3.5.3 requires multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged accounts. \u2022 Finally, MA.L2-3.7.5 requires the addition of multifactor authentication for remote maintenance sessions. Example You often need to work from remote locations, such as your home or client sites, and you are permitted to access your organization\u2019s internal networks (including a network containing CUI) from those remote locations [a]. A system administrator issues you a company laptop with VPN software installed, which is required to connect to the networks remotely [b]. After the laptop connects to the VPN server, you must accept a privacy notice that states that the company\u2019s security department may monitor the connection. This monitoring is achieved through the analysis of data from sensors on the network notifying IT if issues arise. The security department may also review audit logs to see who is connecting remotely, when, and what information they are accessing [d]. During session establishment, the message \u201cVerifying Compliance\u201d means software like a Device Health Check (DHC) application is checking the remote device to ensure it meets the established requirements to connect [c]. AC.L2-3.1.12 \u2013 Control Remote Access CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 42 Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Do policies identify when remote access is permitted and what methods must be used [a,b]? \u2022 Are systems configured to permit only approved remote access sessions (e.g., disallow remote access sessions by default) [c]? \u2022 Are automated or manual mechanisms employed for monitoring remote connections? If the monitoring is manual, does it occur at a frequency commensurate with the level of risk [d]?",

Security-relevant information is any information within the system that can potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a manner that could result in failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain isolation of code and data. Privileged commands give individuals the ability to execute sensitive, security-critical, or security-relevant system functions. Controlling such access from remote locations helps to ensure that unauthorized individuals are not able to execute such commands freely with the potential to do serious or catastrophic damage to 40 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 15. 41 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 14. AC.L2-3.1.15 \u2013 Privileged Remote Access CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 48 organizational systems. Note that the ability to affect the integrity of the system is considered security-relevant as that could enable the means to by-pass security functions although not directly impacting the function itself. FURTHER DISCUSSION Privileged users are not necessarily allowed to perform their job functions from a remote location. Likewise, not all privileged commands may be executed remotely. Allowing remote execution of privileged commands or remote access to security-relevant information should be avoided if possible. If absolutely necessary, the privileged commands authorized for remote execution should be identified and documented. Document which user roles have permissions to remotely execute privileged commands to make changes and to access security relevant information. Documentation must be used to establish security mechanisms that enforce the policy. This requirement, AC.L2-3.1.15, requires authorization for privileged commands executed during a remote session and complements five other requirements dealing with remote access (AC.L2-3.1.12, AC.L2-3.1.14, AC.L2-3.1.13, IA.L2-3.5.3, and MA.L2-3.7.5): \u2022 AC.L2-3.1.12 requires the control of remote access sessions. \u2022 AC.L2-3.1.14 limits remote access to specific access control points. \u2022 AC.L2-3.1.13 requires the use of cryptographic mechanisms when enabling remote sessions. \u2022 IA.L2-3.5.3 requires multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged accounts. \u2022 Finally, MA.L2-3.7.5 requires the addition of multifactor authentication for remote maintenance sessions. This requirement, AC.L2-3.1.15, also extends AC.L2-3.1.2, which limits the types of transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to execute. Example Your company\u2019s Access Control Policy permits certain work roles to remotely perform a limited set of privileged commands from company-owned computers [a]. You implement controls to enforce who can remotely execute a privileged command, which privileged commands they can execute, and who is allowed access to security relevant information such as audit log configuration settings [a,c,d].

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]45 Organizations authenticate individuals and devices to help protect wireless access to the system. Special attention is given to the wide variety of devices that are part of the Internet of Things with potential wireless access to organizational systems. FURTHER DISCUSSION Use a combination of authentication and encryption methods to protect the access to wireless networks. Authenticating users to a wireless access point can be achieved in multiple ways. The most common authentication and encryption methods used include: \u2022 WPA2-PSK (WiFi Protected Access-Pre-shared Key) \u2013 This method uses a password or passphrase known by the wireless access point and the client (user device). It is common in small companies that have little turnover because the key must be changed each time an employee leaves in order to prevent the terminated employee from connecting to the 44 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 16. 45 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 14-15. AC.L2-3.1.17 \u2013 Wireless Access Protection CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 53 network without authorization. WPA2 is typically configured to use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption. \u2022 WPA2 Enterprise \u2013 This method may be better for larger companies and enterprise networks because authentication is based on the identity of the individual user or device rather than a shared password or passphrase. It typically requires a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server for authentication and can provide higher security than WPA2-PSK. Open authentication must not be used because it authenticates any user and lacks security capabilities. Because the use of cryptography in this requirement is to protect the confidentiality of CUI, the cryptography used must meet the criteria specified in requirement SC.L2-3.13.11. AC.L2-3.1.16, AC.L2-3.1.17, and AC.L2-3.1.18 are complementary requirements in that they all establish control for the connection of mobile devices and wireless devices through the use of authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms. Example 1 You manage the wireless network at a small company and are installing a new wireless solution that may transmit CUI. You start by selecting a product that employs encryption validated against the FIPS 140 standard. You configure the wireless solution to use WPA2, requiring users to enter a pre-shared key to connect to the wireless network [a,b]. Example 2 You manage the wireless network at a large company and are installing a new wireless solution that may transmit CUI. You start by selecting a product that employs encryption that is validated against the FIPS 140 standard. Because of the size of your workforce, you configure the wireless system to authenticate users with a RADIUS server. Users must provide the wireless system with their domain usernames and passwords to be able to connect, and the RADIUS server verifies those credentials. Users unable to authenticate are denied access [a,b]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is wireless access limited only to authenticated and authorized users (e.g., required to supply a username and password) [a]? \u2022 If the organization is securing its wireless network with a pre-shared key, is access to that key restricted to only authorized users [a]? \u2022 Is wireless access encrypted using FIPS-validated cryptography? Note that simply using an approved algorithm is not sufficient; the module (software and/or hardware) used to implement the algorithm must be separately validated under FIPS 140 [b].",

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]47 A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information); possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples of mobile devices include smart phones, e-readers, and tablets. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different types of devices. Usage restrictions and implementation guidance for mobile devices include: device identification 46 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 16. 47 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 15. AC.L2-3.1.18 \u2013 Mobile Device Connection CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 55 and authentication; configuration management; implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall); scanning devices for malicious code; updating virus protection software; scanning for critical software updates and patches; conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks; and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). The need to provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond this requirement. Many controls for mobile devices are reflected in other CUI security requirements. NIST SP 800-124 provides guidance on mobile device security. FURTHER DISCUSSION Establish guidelines and acceptable requirements for proper configuration, use, and management of mobile devices. Devices that process, store, or transmit CUI must be identified with a device-specific identifier. There are many different types of identifiers, and it is important to select one that can accommodate all devices and be used in a consistent manner. These identifiers are important for facilitating the required monitoring and logging function. In addition to smartphones, consider the security of other portable devices such as e-readers and tablets. AC.L2-3.1.16, AC.L2-3.1.17, and AC.L2-3.1.18 are complementary requirements in that they all establish control for the connection of mobile devices and wireless devices through the use of authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms. Example Your organization has a policy stating that all mobile devices, including iPads, tablets, mobile phones, and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), must be approved and registered with the IT department before connecting to the network that contains CUI. The IT department uses a Mobile Device Management solution to monitor mobile devices and enforce policies across the enterprise [b,c].

Container-based encryption provides a more fine-grained approach to the encryption of data and information including encrypting selected data structures such as files, records, or fields. FURTHER DISCUSSION Ensure CUI is encrypted on all mobile devices and mobile computing platforms that process, store, or transmit CUI including smartphones, tablets, and e-readers. 48 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 17. 49 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 15. AC.L2-3.1.19 \u2013 Encrypt CUI on Mobile CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 57 Because the use of cryptography in this requirement is to protect the confidentiality of CUI, the cryptography used must meet the criteria specified in requirement SC.L2-3.13.11. This requirement, AC.L2-3.1.19, specifies that CUI be encrypted on mobile devices and extends three other CUI protection requirements (MP.L2-3.8.1, MP.L2-3.8.2, and SC.L2- 3.13.16): \u2022 MP.L2-3.8.1 requires that media containing CUI be protected. \u2022 MP.L2-3.8.2 limits access to CUI to authorized users. \u2022 Finally, SC.L2-3.13.16 requires confidentiality of CUI at rest. This requirement, AC.L2-3.1.19, also leverages SC.L2-3.13.11, which specifies that the algorithms used must be FIPS-validated cryptography, and SC.L2-3.13.10, which specifies that any cryptographic keys in use must be protected. Example You are in charge of mobile device security for a company that processes CUI. You configure all laptops to use the full-disk encryption technology built into the operating system. This approach is FIPS-validated and encrypts all files, folders, and volumes. Phones and tablets pose a greater technical challenge with their wide range of manufacturers and operating systems. You select a proprietary mobile device management (MDM) solution to enforce FIPS-validated encryption on those devices [a,b]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is a list maintained of mobile devices and mobile computing platforms that are permitted to process, store, or transmit CUI [a]? \u2022 Is CUI encrypted on mobile devices using FIPS-validated algorithms [b]?

Test [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing terms and conditions on use of external systems]. DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]51 External systems are systems or components of systems for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application of security requirements and controls or the determination of the effectiveness of implemented controls on those systems. External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices and privately- owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities. 50 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 17. 51 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 15-16. AC.L2-3.1.20 \u2013 External Connections [CUI Data] CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 59 This requirement also addresses the use of external systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of CUI, including accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational systems. Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum, the types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems. This requirement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals using external systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access organizational systems. In those situations, organizations need confidence that the external systems contain the necessary controls so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification that the required controls have been effectively implemented can be achieved by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the assurance or confidence level required by organizations. Note that while \u201cexternal\u201d typically refers to outside of the organization\u2019s direct supervision and authority, that is not always the case. Regarding the protection of CUI across an organization, the organization may have systems that process CUI and others that do not. And among the systems that process CUI there are likely access restrictions for CUI that apply between systems. Therefore, from the perspective of a given system, other systems within the organization may be considered \u201cexternal\" to that system. FURTHER DISCUSSION Control and manage connections between your company network and outside networks. Outside networks could include the public internet, one of your own company\u2019s networks that falls outside of your CMMC Assessment Scope (e.g., an isolated lab), or a network that does not belong to your company. Tools to accomplish include firewalls and connection allow/deny lists. External systems not controlled by your company could be running applications that are prohibited or blocked. Control and limit access to corporate networks from personally owned devices such as laptops, tablets, and phones. You may choose to limit how and when your network is connected to outside systems or only allow certain employees to connect to outside systems from network resources. Example Your company has a project that contains CUI. You remind your coworkers of the policy requirement to use their company laptops, not personal laptops or tablets, when working remotely on the project [b,f]. You also remind everyone to work from the cloud environment that is approved for processing and storing CUI rather than the other collaborative tools that may be used for other projects [b,f].

Note that while \u201cexternal\u201d typically refers to outside of the organization\u2019s direct supervision and authority, that is not always the case. Regarding the protection of FCI across an organization, the organization may have systems that process FCI and others that do not. And among the systems that process FCI there are likely access restrictions for FCI that apply between systems. Therefore, from the perspective of a given system, other systems within the organization may be considered \u201cexternal\" to that system. FURTHER DISCUSSION Control and manage connections between your company network and outside networks. Outside networks could include the public internet, one of your own company\u2019s networks that falls outside of your CMMC Assessment Scope (e.g., an isolated lab), or a network that does not belong to your company. Tools to manage connections include firewalls and connection allow/deny lists. External systems not controlled by your company could be running applications that are prohibited or blocked. Control and limit access to corporate networks from personally owned devices such as laptops, tablets, and phones. You may choose to limit how and when your network is connected to outside systems or only allow certain employees to connect to outside systems from network resources. Example Your company has just been awarded a contract which contains FCI. You remind your coworkers of the policy requirement to use their company laptops, not personal laptops or tablets, when working remotely on this contract [b,f]. You also remind everyone to work from the cloud environment that is approved for processing and storing FCI rather than the other collaborative tools that may be used for other projects [b,f].

Assessment objective (3.1.21[c]): use of organizational portable storage devices containing CUI on external systems is limited as defined.. POA&M allowed: Yes. SPRS score: 1.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]53 Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices in external systems include complete prohibition of the use of such devices or restrictions on how the devices may be used and under what conditions the devices may be used. Note that while \u201cexternal\u201d typically refers to outside of the organization\u2019s direct supervision and authority that is not always the case. Regarding the protection of CUI across an organization, the organization may have systems that process CUI and others that do not. Among the systems that process CUI there are likely access restrictions for CUI that apply between systems. Therefore, from 52 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 18. 53 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 16. AC.L2-3.1.21 \u2013 Portable Storage Use CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 62 the perspective of a given system, other systems within the organization may be considered \u201cexternal\" to that system. FURTHER DISCUSSION A portable storage device is a system component that can be inserted or attached and easily removed from a system. It is used to store data or information. Examples of portable storage devices include: \u2022 compact/digital video disks (CDs/DVDs); \u2022 Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives; \u2022 external hard disk drives; \u2022 flash memory cards/drives; and \u2022 floppy disks. This requirement can be implemented in two ways: \u2022 identifying the portable storage device usage restrictions, identifying portable storage devices that may be used on external systems, identifying associated external systems on which a portable storage device may be used, and administratively (through the use of a written policy) limiting the usage of the devices to those systems; or \u2022 configuring devices to work only when connected to a system to which the portable storage device can authenticate, limiting the devices\u2019 use on external systems to those that the OSA has the ability to manage. Example Your organization, which stores and processes CUI, has a written portable device usage restriction policy. It states that users can only use external storage devices such as thumb dives or external hard disks that belong to the company. When needed for a specific business function, a user checks the device out from IT and returns it to IT when no longer needed [a,b]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are the portable storage devices authorized for external use identified and documented [a]? \u2022 Are the circumstances defined in which portable storage devices containing CUI may be used on external systems (e.g., with management approval) [b]? \u2022 Are limitations stipulated for the use of portable storage devices containing CUI on external systems (e.g., authorized personnel only, encrypted drives required) [b]?",

Individuals authorized to post FCI onto publicly accessible systems are designated. The content of information is reviewed prior to posting onto publicly accessible systems to ensure that nonpublic information is not included. FURTHER DISCUSSION Only government officials can be authorized to publicly release FCI. Do not allow FCI to become public \u2013 always safeguard the confidentiality of FCI by controlling the posting of FCI on company-controlled websites or public forums and the exposure of FCI in public presentations or on public displays. It is important to know which users are allowed to publish information on publicly accessible systems, like your company website, and implement a review process before posting such information. If FCI is discovered on a publicly accessible system, procedures should be in place to remove that information and alert the appropriate parties. Example Your company decides to start issuing press releases about its projects in an effort to reach more potential customers. Your company receives FCI from the government as part of its DoD contract. Because you recognize the need to manage controlled information, including FCI, you meet with the employees who write the releases and post information to establish a review process [c]. It is decided that you will review press releases for FCI before posting it on the company website [a,d]. Only certain employees will be authorized to post to the website [a].

The content also addresses awareness of the need for operations security. Security awareness techniques include: formal training; offering supplies inscribed with security reminders; generating email advisories or notices from organizational officials; displaying logon screen messages; displaying security awareness posters; and conducting information security awareness events. NIST SP 800-50 provides guidance on security awareness and training programs. FURTHER DISCUSSION Awareness training focuses user attention on security. Several techniques can be used, such as: \u2022 synchronous or asynchronous training; \u2022 simulations (e.g., simulated phishing emails); \u2022 security awareness campaigns (posters, reminders, group discussions); and \u2022 communicating regular email advisories and notices to employees. Awareness training and role-based training are different. This requirement, AT.L2-3.2.1, covers awareness training, which provides general security training to influence user behavior. This training can apply broadly or be tailored to a specific role. Role-based training focuses on the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to complete a specific job and is covered by AT.L2-3.2.2. Example Your organization holds a DoD contract which requires the use of CUI. You want to provide information to employees so they can identify phishing emails. To do this, you prepare a presentation that highlights basic traits, including: \u2022 suspicious-looking email address or domain name; \u2022 a message that contains an attachment or URL; and \u2022 a message that is poorly written and often contains obvious misspelled words. You encourage everyone to not click on attachments or links in a suspicious email [c]. You tell employees to forward such a message immediately to IT security [d]. You download free security awareness posters to hang in the office [c,d]. You send regular emails and tips to all employees to ensure your message is not forgotten over time [c,d]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Do all users, managers, and system administrators receive initial and refresher training commensurate with their roles and responsibilities [c,d]? \u2022 Do training materials identify the organization-defined security requirements that must be met by users while interacting with the system as described in written policies, standards, and procedures [d]?

Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and technical controls. Such training can include policies, procedures, tools, and artifacts for the security roles defined. Organizations also provide the training necessary for individuals to carry out their responsibilities related to operations and supply chain security within the context of organizational information security programs. NIST SP 800-181 provides guidance on role-based information security training in the workplace. SP 800-161 provides guidance on supply chain risk management. FURTHER DISCUSSION Training imparts skills and knowledge to enable staff to perform a specific job function. Training should be available to all employees for all organizational roles to accommodate role changes without being constrained by the training schedule. Awareness training and role-based training are different. Awareness training provides general security training to influence user behavior and is covered by AT.L2-3.2.1. This requirement, AT.L2-3.2.2, covers role-based training that focuses on the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to complete a specific job. Role-based training may include awareness topics specific to individual roles such as ensuring systems administrators understand the risk associated with using an administrative account. Example Your company upgraded the firewall to a newer, more advanced system to protect the CUI it stores. You have been identified as an employee who needs training on the new device [a,b,c]. This will enable you to use the firewall effectively and efficiently. Your company considered training resources when it planned for the upgrade and ensured that training funds were available as part of the upgrade project [c].

Assessment objective (3.2.3[b]): security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat is provided to managers and employees.. POA&M allowed: Yes. SPRS score: 1.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]61 Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat include behaviors such as: inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information that is not required for job performance; unexplained access to financial resources; bullying or sexual harassment of fellow employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of the policies, procedures, directives, rules, or practices of organizations. Security awareness training includes how to communicate employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of insider threat through appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established organizational policies and procedures. Organizations may consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to the role (e.g., training for managers may be focused on specific changes in behavior of team members, while training for employees may be focused on more general observations). 60 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 20. 61 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 17. AT.L2-3.2.3 \u2013 Insider Threat Awareness CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 71 FURTHER DISCUSSION An insider threat is the threat that an insider will use their authorized access, wittingly or unwittingly, to do harm. Insider threat security awareness training focuses on recognizing employee behaviors and characteristics that might be indicators of an insider threat and the guidelines and procedures to handle and report it. Training for managers will provide guidance on observing team members to identify all potential threat indicators, while training for general employees will provide guidance for focusing on a smaller number of indicators. Employee behaviors will vary depending on roles, team membership, and associated information needs. The person responsible for specifying insider threat indicators must be cognizant of these factors. Because of this, organizations may choose to tailor the training for specific roles. This requirement does not require separate training regarding insider threat. Organizations may choose to integrate these topics into their standard security awareness training programs. Example You are responsible for training all employees on the awareness of high-risk behaviors that can indicate a potential insider threat [b]. You educate yourself on the latest research on insider threat indicators by reviewing a number of law enforcement bulletins [a]. You then add the following example to the training package: A baseline of normal behavior for work schedules has been created. One employee\u2019s normal work schedule is 8:00 AM\u20135:00 PM, but another employee noticed that the employee has been working until 9:00 PM every day even though no projects requiring additional hours have been assigned [b]. The observing employee reports the abnormal work schedule using the established reporting guidelines. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Do training materials include potential indicators associated with insider threats (e.g., repeated security violations, unusual work hours, unexpected significant transfers of data, suspicious contacts, concerning behaviors outside the workplace) [a,b]? \u2022 Do training materials include methods of reporting potential indicators of insider threats to management or responsible security personnel [b]?",

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]63 An event is any observable occurrence in a system, which includes unlawful or unauthorized system activity. Organizations identify event types for which a logging functionality is needed as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the environments in which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, administrative privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the CUI security requirements. Monitoring and auditing requirements can be balanced with other system needs. For example, organizations may determine that systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit logging capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of event types, the logging necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented or cloud-based architectures. Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes time stamps, source and destination addresses, user or process identifiers, event descriptions, success or failure indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the system after the event occurred). Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records includes full text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users. Organizations consider limiting the additional audit log information to only that information explicitly needed for specific audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and audit logs by not including information that could potentially be misleading or could make it more difficult to locate information of interest. Audit logs are reviewed and analyzed as often as needed to provide important information to organizations to facilitate risk-based decision making. NIST SP 800-92 provides guidance on security log management. FURTHER DISCUSSION OSAs must ensure that all applicable systems create and retain audit logs that contain enough information to identify and investigate potentially unlawful or unauthorized system activity. OSAs must define the audit logs it needs to collect as well as the specific events to capture within the selected logs. Captured audit records are checked to verify that they contain the required events. 63 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 17-18. AU.L2-3.3.1 \u2013 System Auditing CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 74 In defining the audit log retention period, OSAs must ensure that logs are retained for a sufficiently long period to allow for the investigation of a security event. The retention period must take into account the delay of weeks or months that can occur between an initial compromise and the discovery of attacker activity. Example You set up audit logging capability for your company. You determine that all systems that contain CUI must have extra detail in the audit logs. Because of this, you configure these systems to log the following information for all user actions [b,c]: \u2022 time stamps; \u2022 source and destination addresses; \u2022 user or process identifiers; \u2022 event descriptions; \u2022 success or fail indications; and \u2022 filenames.

This requirement applies to each audit record data storage repository (i.e., distinct system component where audit records are stored), the total audit record storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit record data storage repositories combined), or both. 68 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 22. 69 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 19. AU.L2-3.3.4 \u2013 Audit Failure Alerting CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 80 FURTHER DISCUSSION Audit logging keeps track of activities occurring on the network, servers, user workstations, and other components of the overall system. These logs must always be available and functional. The company\u2019s designated security personnel (e.g., system administrator and security officer) need to be aware when the audit log process fails or becomes unavailable [a]. Notifications (e.g., email, Short Message Service (SMS)) should to be sent to the company\u2019s designated security personnel to immediately take appropriate action. If security personnel are unaware of the audit logging process failure, then they will be unaware of any suspicious activity occurring at that time. Response to an audit logging process failure should account for the extent of the failure (e.g., a single component\u2019s audit logging versus failure of the centralized logging solution), the risks involved in this loss of audit logging, and other factors (e.g., the possibility that an adversary could have caused the audit logging process failure). Example You are in charge of IT operations for a company that processes CUI, and your responsibilities include managing the audit logging process. You configure your systems to send you an email in the event of an audit log failure. One day, you receive one of these alerts. You connect to the system, restart logging, and determine why the logging stopped [a,b,c].

Regarding the assessment of a given organizational system, the requirement is agnostic as to whether this correlation is applied at the system level or at the organization level across all systems. FURTHER DISCUSSION Companies must review, analyze, and report audit records to help detect and respond to security incidents in a timely manner for the purpose of investigation and corrective actions. Collection of audit logs into one or more central repositories may facilitate correlated review. 70 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 23. 71 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 19. AU.L2-3.3.5 \u2013 Audit Correlation CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 82 Small companies may be able to accomplish this manually with well-defined and -managed procedures. Larger companies will use an automated system for analysis that correlates log data from across the entire enterprise. Some companies may want to orchestrate the analysis process to include the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for collection, correlation, and the automation of responses based on programed rulesets. Example You are a member of a cyber defense team responsible for audit log analysis. You run an automated tool that analyzes all the audit logs across a Local Area Network (LAN) segment simultaneously looking for similar anomalies on separate systems at separate locations. Some of these systems store CUI. After extracting anomalous information and performing a correlation analysis [b], you determine that four different systems have had their event log information cleared between 2:00 AM to 3:00 AM, although the associated dates are different. The team monitors all systems on the same LAN segment between 2:00 AM to 3:00 AM for the next 30 days. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are mechanisms used across different repositories to integrate audit review, analysis, correlation, and reporting processes [b]?",

SPRS score: 1.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]73 Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit record reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same system or organizational entities conducting auditing activities. Audit record reduction capability can include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the system can help generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the granularity of the time stamp in the record is insufficient. 72 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 23. 73 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 19. AU.L2-3.3.6 \u2013 Reduction & Reporting CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 84 FURTHER DISCUSSION Raw audit log data is difficult to review, analyze, and report because of the volume of data. Audit record reduction is an automated process that interprets raw audit log data and extracts meaningful and relevant information without altering the original logs. An example of log reduction for files to be analyzed would be the removal of details associated with nightly backups. Report generation on reduced log information allows you to create succinct customized reports without the need to burden the reader with unimportant information. In addition, the security-relevant audit information must be made available to personnel on demand for immediate review, analysis, reporting, and event investigation support. Performing audit log reduction and providing on-demand reports may allow the analyst to take mitigating action before an adversary completes its malicious actions. Example You are in charge of IT operations in a company that processes CUI. You are responsible for providing audit record reduction and report generation capability. To support this function, you deploy an open-source solution that will collect and analyze data for signs of anomalies. The solution queries your central log repository to extract relevant data and provide you with a concise and comprehensive view for further analysis to identify potentially malicious activity [a]. In addition to creating on-demand data sets for analysis, you create customized reports explaining the contents of the data set [b]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Does the system support on-demand audit review, analysis, and reporting requirements and after-the-fact security investigations [b]?",

POA&M allowed: Yes. SPRS score: 1.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]75 Internal system clocks are used to generate time stamps, which include date and time. Time is expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for different system components. Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms 74 NIST SP 800-171A, pp. 23-24. 75 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 19. AU.L2-3.3.7 \u2013 Authoritative Time Source CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 86 used to support those capabilities. This requirement provides uniformity of time stamps for systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network. FURTHER DISCUSSION Each system must synchronize its time with a central time server to ensure that all systems are recording audit logs using the same time source. Reviewing audit logs from multiple systems can be a difficult task if time is not synchronized. Systems can be synchronized to a network device or directory service or configured manually. Example You are setting up several new computers on your company\u2019s network, which contains CUI. You update the time settings on each machine to use the same authoritative time server on the internet [b,c]. When you review audit logs, all your machines will have synchronized time, which aids in any potential security investigations. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Can the records\u2019 time stamps map to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), compare system clocks with authoritative Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers, and synchronize system clocks when the time difference is greater than 1 second [c]? \u2022 Does the system synchronize internal system clocks on a defined frequency [c]?",

SPRS score: 1.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]77 Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit log settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit system activity. Audit logging tools are those programs and devices used to conduct audit and logging activities. This requirement focuses on the technical protection of audit information and limits the ability to access and execute audit logging tools to authorized individuals. Physical protection of audit information is addressed by media protection and physical and environmental protection requirements. 76 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 24. 77 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 20. AU.L2-3.3.8 \u2013 Audit Protection CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 88 FURTHER DISCUSSION Audit information is a critical record of what events occurred, the source of the events, and the outcomes of the events; this information needs to be protected. The logs must be properly secured so that the information may not be modified or deleted, either intentionally or unintentionally. Only those with a legitimate need-to-know should have access to audit information, whether that information is being accessed directly from logs or from audit tools. Example You are in charge of IT operations in a company that handles CUI. Your responsibilities include protecting audit information and audit logging tools. You protect the information from modification or deletion by having audit log events forwarded to a central server and by restricting the local audit logs to only be viewable by the system administrators [a,b,c]. Only a small group of security professionals can view the data on the central audit server [b,c,d]. For an additional layer of protection, you back up the server daily and encrypt the backups before sending them to a cloud data repository [a,b,c].

AU.L2-3.3.9 \u2013 Audit Management CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 90 FURTHER DISCUSSION Companies should restrict access to audit logging functions to a limited number of privileged users who can modify audit logs and audit settings. General users should not be granted permissions to perform audit management. All audit managers should be privileged users, but only a small subset of privileged users will be given audit management responsibilities. Functions performed by privileged users must be distinctly separate from the functions performed by users who have audit-related responsibilities to reduce the potential of fraudulent activities by privileged users not being detected or reported. When possible, individuals who manage audit logs should not have access to other privileged functions. Example You are responsible for the administration of select company infrastructure that contains CUI, but you are not responsible for managing audit information. You are not permitted to review audit logs, delete audit logs, or modify audit log settings [b]. Full control of audit logging functions has been given to senior system administrators [a,b].

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]81 This requirement establishes and maintains baseline configurations for systems and system components including for system communications and connectivity. Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and agreed-upon sets of specifications for systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, and changes to systems. Baseline configurations include information about system components (e.g., standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook computers, servers, network components, or mobile devices; current version numbers and update and patch information on operating systems and applications; and configuration settings and parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those components within the system architecture. Baseline configurations of systems also reflect the current enterprise architecture. Maintaining effective baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational systems change over time. Baseline configuration maintenance includes reviewing and updating the baseline configuration when changes are made based on security risks and deviations from the established baseline configuration. Organizations can implement centralized system component inventories that include components from multiple organizational systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the resulting inventories include system-specific information required for proper component accountability (e.g., system association, system owner). Information deemed necessary for effective accountability of system components includes hardware inventory specifications, software license information, software version numbers, component owners, and for networked components or devices, machine names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include manufacturer, device type, model, serial number, and physical location. NIST SP 800-128 provides guidance on security-focused configuration management. FURTHER DISCUSSION An effective cybersecurity program depends on consistent, secure system and component configuration and management. Build and configure systems from a known, secure, and approved configuration baseline.

Example You are in charge of upgrading the computer operating systems of your office\u2019s computers. Some of these computers process, store, or transmit CUI. You research how to set up and configure a workstation with the least functionality and highest security and use that as the framework for creating a configuration that minimizes functionality while still allowing users to do their tasks. After testing the new baseline on a single workstation, you document this configuration and apply it to the other computers [a]. You then check to make sure that the software changes are accurately reflected in your master system inventory [e]. Finally, you set a calendar reminder to review the baseline in three months [f]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Do baseline configurations include software versions and patch level, configuration parameters, network information, and communications with connected systems [a,b]? \u2022 Are baseline configurations updated as needed to accommodate security risks or software changes [c]?",

Information technology products for which security-related configuration settings can be defined include mainframe computers, servers, workstations, input and output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, 82 NIST SP 800-171A, pp. 26-27. 83 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 21.

Security parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of systems including the parameters required to satisfy other security requirements. Security parameters include: registry settings; account, file, directory permission settings; and settings for functions, ports, protocols, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for systems. The established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline. Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations including information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private sectors. NIST SP 800-70 and SP 800-128 provide guidance on security configuration settings. FURTHER DISCUSSION Information security is an integral part of a company\u2019s configuration management process. Security-related configuration settings are customized to satisfy the company\u2019s security requirements and are applied them to all systems once tested and approved. The configuration settings must reflect the most restrictive settings that are appropriate for the system. Any required deviations from the baseline are reviewed, documented, and approved. Example You manage baseline configurations for your company\u2019s systems, including those that process, store, and transmit CUI. As part of this, you download a secure configuration guide for each of your asset types (servers, workstations, network components, operating systems, middleware, and applications) from a well-known and trusted IT security organization. You then apply all of the settings that you can while still ensuring the assets can perform the role for which they are needed. Once you have the configuration settings identified and tested, you document them to ensure all applicable machines can be configured the same way [a,b]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Do security settings reflect the most restrictive settings appropriate [a]? \u2022 Are changes or deviations to security settings documented [b]?",

SPRS score: 1.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]85 Tracking, reviewing, approving/disapproving, and logging changes is called configuration change control. Configuration change control for organizational systems involves the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of changes to the systems, including system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to baseline configurations for components and configuration items of systems, changes to configuration settings for information technology products (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, and mobile devices), unscheduled and unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities. 84 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 27. 85 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 21 CM.L2-3.4.3 \u2013 System Change Management CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 97 Processes for managing configuration changes to systems include Configuration Control Boards or Change Advisory Boards that review and approve proposed changes to systems. For new development systems or systems undergoing major upgrades, organizations consider including representatives from development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards or Change Advisory Boards. Audit logs of changes include activities before and after changes are made to organizational systems and the activities required to implement such changes. NIST SP 800-128 provides guidance on configuration change control. FURTHER DISCUSSION You must track, review, and approve configuration changes before committing to production. Changes to computing environments can create unintended and unforeseen issues that can affect the security and availability of the systems, including those that process CUI. Relevant experts and stakeholders must review and approve proposed changes. They should discuss potential impacts before the organization puts the changes in place. Relevant items include changes to the physical environment and to the systems hosted within it. Example Once a month, the management and technical team leads join a change control board meeting. During this meeting, everyone reviews all proposed changes to the environment [b,c]. This includes changes to the physical and computing environments. The meeting ensures that relevant subject-matter experts review changes and propose alternatives where needed. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are changes to the system authorized by company management and documented [a,b,c,d]? \u2022 Are changes documented and tracked (e.g., manually written down or included in a tracking service such as a ticketing system) [d]?",

Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries. Access restrictions include physical and logical access control requirements, workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into external interfaces rather than directly into systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during certain specified times). In addition to security concerns, commonly-accepted due diligence for configuration management includes access restrictions as an essential part in ensuring the ability to effectively manage the configuration. NIST SP 800-128 provides guidance on configuration change control. FURTHER DISCUSSION Define, identify, and document qualified individuals authorized to make physical and logical changes to the organization\u2019s hardware, software, software libraries, or firmware components. Control of configuration management activities may involve: \u2022 physical access control that prohibits unauthorized users from gaining physical access to an asset (e.g., requiring a special key card to enter a server room); \u2022 logical access control that prevents unauthorized users from logging onto a system to make configuration changes (e.g., requiring specific credentials for modifying configuration settings, patching software, or updating software libraries); \u2022 workflow automation in which configuration management workflow rules define human tasks and data or files are routed between people authorized to do configuration management based on pre-defined business rules (e.g., passing an electronic form to a manager requesting approval of configuration change made by an authorized employee); \u2022 an abstraction layer for configuration management that requires changes be made from an external system through constrained interface (e.g., software updates can only be made from a patch management system with a specific IP address); and \u2022 utilization of a configuration management change window (e.g., software updates are only allowed between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM or between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM). Example Your datacenter requires expanded storage capacity in a server. The change has been approved, and security is planning to allow an external technician to access the building at a specific date and time under the supervision of a manager [a,b,c,d]. A system administrator creates a temporary privileged account that can be used to log into the server\u2019s operating system and update storage settings [e,f,g]. On the appointed day, the technician is escorted 89 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 22.

Some of the functions and services routinely provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. It is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single system components. However, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per component. Organizations review functions and services provided by systems or components of systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations disable unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, transfer of information, and tunneling.

CM.L2-3.4.6 \u2013 Least Functionality CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 104 can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end- point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services. FURTHER DISCUSSION You should customize organizational systems to remove non-essential applications and disable unnecessary services. Systems come with many unnecessary applications and settings enabled by default including unused ports and protocols. Leave only the fewest capabilities necessary for the systems to operate effectively. Example You have ordered a new server, which has arrived with a number of free utilities installed in addition to the operating system. Before you deploy the server, you research the utilities to determine which ones can be eliminated without impacting functionality. You remove the unneeded software, then move on to disable unused ports and services. The server that enters production therefore has only the essential capabilities enabled for the system to function in its role [a,b]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are the roles and functions for each system identified along with the software and services required to perform those functions [a]? \u2022 Are the software and services required for those defined functions identified [a]? \u2022 Is the information system configured to exclude any function not needed in the operational environment [b]?",

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]93 Restricting the use of nonessential software (programs) includes restricting the roles allowed to approve program execution; prohibiting auto-execute; program blacklisting and whitelisting; or restricting the number of program instances executed at the same time. The organization makes a security-based determination which functions, ports, protocols, and/or services are restricted. Bluetooth, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and peer-to-peer networking are examples of protocols organizations consider preventing the use of, restricting, or disabling. FURTHER DISCUSSION Organizations should only use the minimum set of programs, services, ports, and protocols required for to accomplish the organization\u2019s mission. This has several implications: \u2022 All unnecessary programs and accounts are removed from all endpoints and servers. \u2022 The organization makes a policy decision to control the execution of programs through either whitelisting or blacklisting. Whitelisting means a program can only run if the software has been vetted in some way, and the executable name has been entered onto a list of allowed software. Blacklisting means any software can execute as long it is not on a list of known malicious software. Whitelisting provides far more security than blacklisting, but the organization\u2019s policy can direct the implementation of either approach. Control of execution applies to both servers and endpoints. \u2022 The organization restricts the use of all unnecessary ports, protocols, and system services in order to limit entry points that attackers can use. For example, the use of the FTP service is eliminated from all computers, and the associated ports are blocked unless a required service utilizes those ports. The elimination of nonessential functionality on the network and systems provides a smaller attack surface for an attacker to gain access and take control of your network or systems. This requirement, CM.L2-3.4.7, which requires limiting functionality to essential programs, ports, protocols, and services, extends CM.L2-3.4.6, which requires adherence to the 93 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 22-23. CM.L2-3.4.7 \u2013 Nonessential Functionality CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 107 principle of least functionality but does not specifically address which elements of a system should be limited. Example You are responsible for purchasing new endpoint hardware, installing organizationally required software to the hardware, and configuring the endpoint in accordance with the organization\u2019s policy. The organization has a system imaging capability that loads all necessary software, but it does not remove unnecessary services, eliminate the use of certain protocols, or close unused ports. After imaging the systems, you close all ports and block the use of all protocols except the following: \u2022 TCP for SSH on port 22; \u2022 SMTP on port 25; \u2022 TCP and UDP on port 53; and \u2022 HTTP and HTTPS on port 443. The use of any other ports or protocols are allowed by exception only [i,l,o]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are only applications and services that are needed for the function of the system configured and enabled [a,b,c,d,e,f]? \u2022 Are only those ports and protocols necessary to provide the service of the information system configured for that system [g,h,i,j,k,l]? \u2022 Are systems services reviewed to determine what is essential for the function of that system [m]?",

The process used to identify software 94 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 30. 95 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 23. CM.L2-3.4.8 \u2013 Application Execution Policy CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 109 programs that are authorized to execute on systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting. Whitelisting is the stronger of the two policies for restricting software program execution. In addition to whitelisting, organizations consider verifying the integrity of whitelisted software programs using, for example, cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash functions. Verification of whitelisted software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup. NIST SP 800-167 provides guidance on application whitelisting. FURTHER DISCUSSION Organizations should determine their blacklisting or whitelisting policy and configure the system to manage software that is allowed to run. Blacklisting or deny-by-exception allows all software to run except if on an unauthorized software list such as what is maintained in antivirus solutions. Whitelisting or permit-by-exception does not allow any software to run except if on an authorized software list. The stronger policy of the two is whitelisting. This requirement, CM.L2-3.4.8, requires the implementation of allow-lists and deny-lists for application software. It leverages CM.L2-3.4.1, which requires the organization to establish and maintain software inventories. This requirement, CM.L2-3.4.8, also extends CM.L2-3.4.9, which only requires control and monitoring of any user installed software. Example To improve your company\u2019s protection from malware, you have decided to allow only designated programs to run. With additional research you identify a capability within the latest operating system that can control executables, scripts, libraries, or application installers run in your environment [c]. To ensure success you begin by authorizing digitally signed executables. Once they are deployed, you then plan to evaluate and deploy whitelisting for software libraries and scripts [c]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is the information system configured to only allow authorized software to run [a,b,c]? \u2022 Is the system configured to disallow running unauthorized software [a,b,c]? \u2022 Is there a defined list of software programs authorized to execute on the system [b]? \u2022 Is the authorization policy a deny-all, permit by exception for software allowed to execute on the system [a,b,c]? \u2022 Are automated mechanisms used to prevent program execution in accordance with defined lists (e.g., whitelisting) [a,b,c]?",

Policy enforcement methods include procedural methods, automated methods, or both. FURTHER DISCUSSION Software that users have the ability to install is limited to items that the organization approves. When not controlled, users could install software that can create unnecessary risk. This risk applies both to the individual machine and to the larger operating environment. Policies and technical controls reduce risk to the organization by preventing users from installing unauthorized software. Example You are a system administrator. A user calls you for help installing a software package. They are receiving a message asking for a password because they do not have permission to install the software. You explain that the policy prohibits users from installing software without approval [a]. When you set up workstations for users, you do not provide administrative privileges. After the call, you redistribute the policy to all users ensuring everyone in the company is aware of the restrictions. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are user controls in place to prohibit the installation of unauthorized software [a]? \u2022 Is all software in use on the information systems approved [b]? \u2022 Is there a mechanism in place to monitor the types of software a user is permitted to download (e.g., is there a whitelist of approved software) [c]?",

Organizational devices requiring 13 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 31 14 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 23 IA.L1-b.1.v \u2013 Identification [FCI Data] CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 1 | Version 2.13 23 identification may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type/device. NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities. FURTHER DISCUSSION Individual, unique identifiers (e.g., user names) should be assigned to all users and processes that access company systems. Authorized devices also should have unique identifiers. Unique identifiers can be as simple as a short set of alphanumeric characters (e.g., SW001 could refer to a network switch, SW002 could refer to a different network switch). This requirement, IA.L1-b.1.v, provides a vetted and trusted identity that supports the access control mechanism required by AC.L1-b.1.i. Example You want to make sure that all employees working on a project can access important information about it. Because this is work for the DoD and contains FCI, you also need to prevent employees who are not working on that project from being able to access the information. You assign each employee a unique user ID, which they use to log on to the system [a]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are unique identifiers issued to individual users (e.g., usernames) [a]? \u2022 Are the processes and service accounts that an authorized user initiates identified (e.g., scripts, automatic updates, configuration updates, vulnerability scans) [b]? \u2022 Are unique device identifiers used for devices that access the system identified [c]?",

Initial authenticator content is the actual content of the authenticator, for example, the initial password. In contrast, the requirements about authenticator content include the minimum password length. Developers ship system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation 15 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 31 16 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 23 IA.L1-b.1.vi \u2013 Authentication [FCI Data] CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 1 | Version 2.13 25 and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk. Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including minimum password length, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include certificates and passwords. NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities. FURTHER DISCUSSION Before a person or device is given system access, verify that the user or device is who or what it claims to be. This verification is called authentication. The most common way to verify identity is using a username and a hard-to-guess password. Some devices ship with a default username (e.g., admin) and password. A default username and password should be immediately changed to something unique. Default passwords may be well known to the public, easily found in a search, or easy to guess, allowing an unauthorized person to access the system. Example 1 You are in charge of purchasing laptops that will store FCI. You know that some laptops come with a default username and password. You notify IT that all default passwords should be reset prior to laptop use [a]. You ask IT to explain the importance of resetting default passwords and convey how easily they are discovered using internet searches during next week\u2019s cybersecurity awareness training. Example 2 Your company decides to use cloud services for email and other capabilities that will transmit FCI. Upon reviewing this requirement, you realize every user or device that connects to the cloud service must be authenticated. As a result, you work with your cloud service provider to ensure that only properly authenticated users and devices are allowed to connect to the system [a,c]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are unique authenticators used to verify user identities (e.g., usernames and passwords) [a]? \u2022 An example of a process acting on behalf of users could be a script that logs in as a person or service account [b]. Can the OSA show that it maintains a record of all of those service accounts for use when reviewing log data or responding to an incident?

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]103 Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to authenticate. The factors are defined as something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number [PIN]); something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators providing time-based or challenge- response authenticators and smart cards. In addition to authenticating users at the system level (i.e., at logon), organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the 102 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 32. 103 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 24-25. IA.L2-3.5.3 \u2013 Multifactor Authentication CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 118 application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security. Access to organizational systems is defined as local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks. The use of encrypted virtual private networks for connections between organization-controlled and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks with regard to protecting the confidentiality of information. NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities. FURTHER DISCUSSION Implement a combination of two or more factors of authentication to verify privileged account holders\u2019 identity regardless of how the user is accessing the account. Implement a combination of two or more factors for non-privileged users accessing the system over a network. The implementation of multi-factor authentication will depend on the environment and business needs. Although two-factor authentication directly on the computer is most common, there are situations (e.g., multi-factor identification for a mission system that cannot be altered) where additional technical or physical solutions can provide security. If a mobile device is used to access a system or application containing CUI, multi-factor authentication is required. This requirement, IA.L2-3.5.3, requires multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged accounts and complements five other requirements dealing with remote access (AC.L2-3.1.12, AC.L2-3.1.14, AC.L2-3.1.13, AC.L2-3.1.15, and MA.L2-3.7.5: \u2022 AC.L2-3.1.12 requires the control of remote access sessions. \u2022 AC.L2-3.1.14 limits remote access to specific access control points. \u2022 AC.L2-3.1.13 requires the use of cryptographic mechanisms when enabling remote sessions. \u2022 AC.L2-3.1.15 requires authorization for privileged commands executed during a remote. \u2022 Finally, MA.L2-3.7.5 requires the addition of multifactor authentication for remote maintenance sessions. This requirement, IA.L2-3.5.3, also enhances IA.L2-3.5.2, which is a requirement for a less rigorous form of user authentication. Example You decide to implement multifactor authentication (MFA) to improve security of your network. Your first step is enabling MFA on VPN access to your internal network [c,d]. When users initiate remote access, they will be prompted for the additional authentication factor. IA.L2-3.5.3 \u2013 Multifactor Authentication CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 119 Because you also use a cloud-based email solution, you require MFA for access to that resource as well [c,d]. Finally, you enable MFA for both local and network logins for the system administrator accounts used to patch and manage servers [a,b,c].

NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities.

You select Kerberos for authentication because of its built-in resistance to replay attacks. As a next step you upgrade all of your web applications to require Transport Layer Security (TLS), which also is replay- resistant.

The number of changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to the total number of positions in the current password. To mitigate certain brute force attacks against passwords, organizations may also consider salting passwords. 110 NIST SP 800-171A, pp. 33-34. 111 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 25. IA.L2-3.5.7 \u2013 Password Complexity CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 127 FURTHER DISCUSSION Password complexity means using different types of characters as well as a specified number of characters. This applies to both the creation of new passwords and the modification of existing passwords. Characters to manage complexity include numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, and symbols. Minimum complexity requirements are left up to the organization to define. Define the lowest level of password complexity required. Define the number of characters that must be changed when an existing password is changed. Enforce these rules for all passwords. Salting passwords adds a string of random characters (salt) to a password prior to hashing. This ensures the randomness of the resulting hash value. Example You work with management to define password complexity rules and ensure they are listed in the company\u2019s security policy. You define and enforce a minimum number of characters for each password and ensure that a certain number of characters must be changed when updating passwords [a,b]. Characters include numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, and symbols [a]. These rules help create hard-to-guess passwords, which help to secure your network. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is a degree of complexity specified for passwords, (e.g., are account passwords a minimum of 12 characters and a mix of upper/lower case, numbers, and special characters), including minimum requirements for each type [a,b,c]? \u2022 Is a change of characters required when new passwords are created [d]?",

Therefore, the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring authenticator feedback includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices or displaying feedback for a very limited time before fully obscuring it. FURTHER DISCUSSION Authentication information includes passwords.

Assessment objective (3.6.1[g]): the operational incident-handling capability includes user response activities.. POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]121 Organizations recognize that incident handling capability is dependent on the capabilities of organizational systems and the mission/business processes being supported by those systems. Organizations consider incident handling as part of the definition, design, and development of mission/business processes and systems. Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources including audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user and administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities including mission/business owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk executive. As part of user response activities, incident response training is provided by organizations and is linked directly to the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, regular users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident on the system; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle or remediate incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system recovery, and restoration. Incident response training includes user training in the identification/reporting of suspicious activities from external and internal sources. User response activities also includes incident response assistance which may consist of help desk support, assistance groups, and access to forensics services or consumer redress services, when required. NIST SP 800-61 provides guidance on incident handling. SP 800-86 and SP 800-101 provide guidance on integrating forensic techniques into incident response. SP 800-161 provides guidance on supply chain risk management. FURTHER DISCUSSION Incident handling capabilities prepare your organization to respond to incidents and may: \u2022 identify people inside and outside your organization you may need to contact during an incident; \u2022 establish a way to report incidents, such as an email address or a phone number; \u2022 establish a system for tracking incidents; and \u2022 determine a place and a way to store evidence of an incident. Software and hardware may be required to analyze incidents when they occur. Incident prevention activities are also part of an incident-handling capability. The incident-handling team provides input for such things as risk assessments and training. OSAs detect incidents using different indicators. Indicators may include: \u2022 alerts from sensors or antivirus software; 121 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 26. IR.L2-3.6.1 \u2013 Incident Handling CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 138 \u2022 a filename that looks unusual; and \u2022 log entries that raise concern. After detecting an incident, an incident response team performs analysis. This requires some knowledge of normal network operations. The incident should be documented including all the log entries associated with the incident. Containment of the incident is a critical step to stop the damage the incident is causing to your network. Containment activities should be based on previously defined organizational priorities and assessment of risk. Recovery activities restore systems to pre-incident functionality and address its underlying causes. Organizations should use recovery activities as a means of improving their overall resilience to future attacks. Example Your manager asks you to set up your company\u2019s incident-response capability [a]. First, you create an email address to collect information on possible incidents. Next, you draft a contact list of all the people who need to know when an incident occurs. You document a procedure for how to submit incidents that includes roles and responsibilities when a potential incident is detected or reported. The procedure also explains how to track incidents, from initial creation to closure [b].

IR.L2-3.6.2 \u2013 Incident Reporting CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 140 forensics, evaluating incident details, trends, and handling. Incident information can be obtained from a variety of sources including incident reports, incident response teams, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user/administrator reports. Reporting incidents addresses specific incident reporting requirements within an organization and the formal incident reporting requirements for the organization. Suspected security incidents may also be reported and include the receipt of suspicious email communications that can potentially contain malicious code. The types of security incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the reports, and the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, and policies. NIST SP 800-61 provides guidance on incident handling. FURTHER DISCUSSION Incident handling is the actions the organization takes to prevent or contain the impact of an incident to the organization while it is occurring or shortly after it has occurred. The majority of the process consists of incident identification, containment, eradication, and recovery. During this process, it is essential to track the work processes required in order to effectively respond. Designate a central hub to serve as the point to coordinate, communicate, and track activities. The hub should receive and document information from system administrators, incident handlers, and others involved throughout the process. As the incident process moves toward eradication, executives, affected business units, and any required external stakeholders should be kept aware of the incident in order to make decisions affecting the business. Report to designated authorities, taking into account applicable laws, directives, regulations, and other guidance. Specify staff responsible for communicating about the incident to internal and external stakeholders. Example You notice unusual activity on a server and determine a potential security incident has occurred. You open a tracking ticket with the Security Operations Center (SOC), which assigns an incident handler to work the ticket [a]. The handler investigates and documents initial findings, which lead to a determination that unauthorized access occurred on the server [b]. The SOC establishes an incident management team consisting of security, database, network, and system administrators. The team meets daily to update progress and plan courses of action to contain the incident [a]. At the end of the day, the team provides a status report to IT executives [d,f]. Two days later, the team declares the incident contained. The team produces a final report as the database system is rebuilt and placed back into operation. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is there an incident response policy that directs the establishment of requirements for tracking and reporting of incidents involving CUI to appropriate officials [a,d]? \u2022 Is cybersecurity incident information promptly reported to management [e,f]?

SPRS score: 1.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]125 Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine the effectiveness of the capabilities and to identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes the use of checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, simulations (both parallel and full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Incident response testing can also include a determination of the effects on organizational operations (e.g., reduction in mission capabilities), organizational assets, and individuals due to incident response. NIST SP 800-84 provides guidance on testing programs for information technology capabilities. FURTHER DISCUSSION Testing incident response capability validates existing plans and highlights potential deficiencies. The test should address questions such as what happens during an incident; 124 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 37. 125 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 27.

Any negative impacts to the normal day-to-day operations when responding to an incident should also be identified and documented. Example You decide to conduct an incident response table top exercise that simulates an attacker gaining access to the network through a compromised server. You include relevant IT staff such as security, database, network, and system administrators as participants. You also request representatives from legal, human resources, and communications. You provide a scenario to the group and have prepared key questions aligned with the response plans to guide the exercise. During the exercise, you focus on how the team executes the incident response plan. Afterward, you conduct a debrief with everyone that was involved to provide feedback and develop improvements to the incident response plan [a].

Organizations have flexibility in determining the controls in place for maintenance tools, but can include approving, controlling, and monitoring the use of such tools. Maintenance tools are potential 128 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 38. 129 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 27-28.

Maintenance tools can include hardware, software, and firmware items, for example, hardware and software diagnostic test equipment and hardware and software packet sniffers. FURTHER DISCUSSION Tools used to perform maintenance must remain secure so they do not introduce viruses or other malware into your system. Controlling your maintenance techniques prevents intentional or unintentional harm to your network and systems. Additionally, the personnel responsible for maintenance activities should be supervised considering their elevated privilege on company assets. Example You are responsible for maintenance activities on your company\u2019s machines. To avoid introducing additional vulnerability into the systems you are maintaining, you make sure that all maintenance tools are approved and their usage is monitored and controlled [a,b].

NIST SP 800-88 provides guidance on media sanitization. FURTHER DISCUSSION Sanitization is a process that makes access to data infeasible on media such as a hard drive. The process may overwrite the entire media with a fixed pattern such as binary zeros. In 130 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 39. 131 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 28. MA.L2-3.7.3 \u2013 Equipment Sanitization CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 149 addition to clearing the data an organization could purge (e.g., degaussing, secure erasing, or disassembling) the data, or even destroy the media (e.g., incinerating, shredding, or pulverizing). Performing one of these activities ensures that the data is extremely hard to recover, thus ensuring its confidentiality. For additional guidance on which specific sanitization actions should be taken on any specific type of media, review the description of the Purge actions given in NIST SP 800-88 Revision 1 \u2013 Guidelines for Media Sanitization. Example You manage your organization\u2019s IT equipment. A recent DoD project has been using a storage array to house CUI. Recently, the array has experienced disk issues. After troubleshooting with the vendor, they recommend several drives be replaced in the array. Knowing the drives may contain CUI, you reference NIST 800-88 Rev. 1 and determine a strategy you can implement on the defective equipment \u2013 processing the drives with a degaussing unit [a]. Once all the drives have been wiped, you document the action and ship the faulty drives to the vendor. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is there a process for sanitizing (e.g., erasing, wiping, degaussing) equipment that was used to store, process, or transmit CUI before it is removed from the facility for off-site maintenance (e.g., manufacturer or contracted maintenance support) [a]?",

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]135 Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through an external network. The authentication techniques employed in the establishment of these nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements in IA.L2-3.5.3. 134 NIST SP 800-171A, pp. 39-40. 135 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 28. MA.L2-3.7.5 \u2013 Nonlocal Maintenance CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 153 FURTHER DISCUSSION Nonlocal maintenance activities must use multifactor authentication. Multifactor authentication requires at least two factors, such as: \u2022 something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number [PIN]); \u2022 something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or \u2022 something you are (e.g., biometric fingerprint or facial scan). Requiring two or more factors to prove your identity increases the security of the connection. Nonlocal maintenance activities are activities conducted from external network connections such as over the internet. After nonlocal maintenance activities are complete, shut down the external network connection. This requirement, MA.L2-3.7.5 specifies the addition of multifactor authentication for remote maintenance sessions and complements five other requirements dealing with remote access (AC.L2-3.1.12, AC.L2-3.1.14, AC.L2-3.1.13, AC.L2-3.1.15, and IA.L2-3.5.3): \u2022 AC.L2-3.1.12 requires the control of remote access sessions. \u2022 AC.L2-3.1.14 limits remote access to specific access control points. \u2022 AC.L2-3.1.13 requires the use of cryptographic mechanisms when enabling remote sessions. \u2022 AC.L2-3.1.15 requires authorization for privileged commands executed during a remote session. \u2022 Finally, IA.L2-3.5.3 requires multifactor authentication for network access to non- privileged accounts. Example You are responsible for maintaining your company\u2019s firewall. In order to conduct maintenance while working remotely, you connect to the firewall\u2019s management interface and log in using administrator credentials. The firewall then sends a verification request to the multifactor authentication app on your smartphone [a]. You need both of these things to prove your identity [a]. After you respond to the multifactor challenge, you have access to the maintenance interface. When you finish your activities, you shut down the remote connection by logging out and quitting your web browser [b]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is multifactor authentication required prior to maintenance of a system when connecting remotely from outside the system boundary [a]? \u2022 Are personnel required to manually terminate remote maintenance sessions established via external network connections when maintenance is complete, or are connections terminated automatically through system session management mechanisms [b]?

Individuals not previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel, such as information technology manufacturers, vendors, consultants, and systems integrators, may require privileged access to organizational systems, for example, when required to conduct maintenance activities with little or no notice. Organizations may choose to issue temporary credentials to these individuals based on organizational risk assessments. Temporary credentials may be for one-time use or for very limited time periods. 136 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 40. 137 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 28. MA.L2-3.7.6 \u2013 Maintenance Personnel CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 156 FURTHER DISCUSSION Individuals without proper permissions must be supervised while conducting maintenance on organizational machines. Consider creating temporary accounts with short-term expiration periods rather than regular user accounts. Additionally, limit the permissions and access these accounts have to the most restrictive settings possible. Example One of your software providers has to come on-site to update the software on your company\u2019s computers. You give the individual a temporary logon and password that expires in 12 hours and is limited to accessing only the computers necessary to complete the work [a]. This gives the technician access long enough to perform the update. You monitor the individual\u2019s physical and network activity while the maintenance is taking place [a] and revoke access when the job is done.

Secure storage includes a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet, or a controlled media library. Access to CUI on system media can be limited by physically controlling such media, which includes conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and return media to the media library, and maintaining accountability for all stored media. NIST SP 800-111 provides guidance on storage encryption technologies for end user devices. FURTHER DISCUSSION CUI can be contained on two types of physical media: \u2022 hardcopy (e.g., CD drives, USB drives, magnetic tape); and \u2022 digital devices (e.g., CD drives, USB drives, video). You should store physical media containing CUI in a secure location. This location should be accessible only to those people with the proper permissions. All who access CUI should follow the process for checking it out and returning it. Example Your company has CUI for a specific Army contract contained on a USB drive. You store the drive in a locked drawer, and you log it on an inventory [d]. You establish a procedure to check out the USB drive so you have a history of who is accessing it. These procedures help to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is hardcopy media containing CUI handled only by authorized personnel according to defined procedures [a]? \u2022 Is digital media containing CUI handled only by authorized personnel according to defined procedures [b]? \u2022 Is paper media containing CUI physically secured (e.g., in a locked drawer or cabinet) [c]? \u2022 Is digital media containing CUI securely stored (e.g., in access-controlled repositories) [d]?",

Examples include: digital media found in workstations, network components, scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, and mobile devices; and non-digital media such as paper and microfilm. The sanitization process removes information from the media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is released for reuse or disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction may be necessary when other methods cannot be applied to the media requiring sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of sanitization techniques and procedures for media containing information that is in the public domain or publicly releasable or deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or 142 NIST SP 800-171A, pp. 41-42. 143 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 29.

NARA policy and guidance control sanitization processes. NIST SP 800-88 provides guidance on media sanitization. FURTHER DISCUSSION \u201cMedia\u201d refers to a broad range of items that store information, including paper documents, disks, tapes, digital photography, USB drives, CDs, DVDs, and mobile phones. It is important to know what information is on media so that you can handle it properly. If there is CUI, you or someone in your company should either: \u2022 shred or destroy the device before disposal so it cannot be read; or \u2022 clean or purge the information, if you want to reuse the device. See NIST Special Publication 800-88, Revision 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, for more information. Example As you pack for an office move, you find some old CDs in a file cabinet. You determine that one has information about an old project your company did for the DoD. You shred the CD rather than simply throwing it in the trash [a].

Controls to maintain accountability for media during transport include locked containers and cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used. Activities associated with transport include the actual transport as well as those activities such as releasing media for transport and ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes. For the actual transport, authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals external to the organization. Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes restricting transport activities to authorized personnel and tracking and obtaining explicit records of 147 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 42. 148 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 30. MP.L2-3.8.5 \u2013 Media Accountability CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 166 transport activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. FURTHER DISCUSSION CUI is protected in both physical and digital formats. Physical control can be accomplished using traditional concepts like restricted access to physical locations or locking papers in a desk or filing cabinet. The digitization of data makes access to CUI much easier. CUI can be stored and transported on magnetic disks, tapes, USB drives, CD-ROMs, and so on. This makes digital CUI data very portable. It is important for an organization to apply mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to CUI due to ease of transport. Example Your team has recently completed configuring a server for a DoD customer. The customer has asked that it be ready to plug in and use. An application installed on the server contains data that is considered CUI. You box the server for shipment using tamper-evident packaging and label it with the specific recipient for the shipment [b]. You select a reputable shipping service so you will get a tracking number to monitor the progress. Once the item is shipped, you send the recipients the tracking number so they can monitor and ensure prompt delivery at their facility. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Do only approved individuals have access to media containing CUI [a]? \u2022 Is access to the media containing CUI recorded in an audit log [b]? \u2022 Is all CUI data on media encrypted or physically locked prior to transport outside of secure locations [b]?",

NIST SP 800-111 provides guidance on storage encryption technologies for end user devices. FURTHER DISCUSSION CUI can be stored and transported on a variety of portable media, which increases the chance that the CUI can be lost. When identifying the paths CUI flows through your company, identify devices to include in this requirement. 149 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 43. 150 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 30. MP.L2-3.8.6 \u2013 Portable Storage Encryption CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 168 To mitigate the risk of losing or exposing CUI, implement an encryption scheme to protect the data. Even if the media are lost, proper encryption renders the data inaccessible. When encryption is not an option, apply alternative physical safeguards during transport. Because the use of cryptography in this requirement is to protect the confidentiality of CUI, the cryptography used must meet the criteria specified in requirement SC.L2-3.13.11. This requirement, MP.L2-3.8.6, provides additional protections to those provided by MP.L2- 3.8.5. This requirement is intended to protect against situations where control of media access fails, such as through the loss of the media. Example You manage the backups for file servers in your datacenter. You know that in addition to the company\u2019s sensitive information, CUI is stored on the file servers. As part of a broader plan to protect data, you send the backup tapes off site to a vendor. You are aware that your backup software provides the option to encrypt data onto tape. You develop a plan to test and enable backup encryption for the data sent off site. This encryption provides additional protections for the data on the backup tapes during transport and offsite storage [a].

Assessment objective (3.8.7): Determine if the use of removable media on system components containing CUI is controlled.. POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]152 In contrast to requirement MP.L2-3.8.1, which restricts user access to media, this requirement restricts the use of certain types of media on systems, for example, restricting or prohibiting the use of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations can employ technical and nontechnical controls (e.g., policies, procedures, and rules of behavior) to control the use of system media. Organizations may control the use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to certain external ports, or disabling or removing the ability to insert, read, or write to such devices. Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices including devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may control the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device, prohibiting the use of writeable, portable devices, and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based technologies. Many technologies and methods 151 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 43. 152 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 30-31. MP.L2-3.8.7 \u2013 Removeable Media CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 170 exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring technologies to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. FURTHER DISCUSSION Removable media are any type of media storage that you can remove from your computer or machine (e.g., CDs, DVDs, diskettes, and USB drives). Write a specific policy for removable media. The policy should cover the various types of removable media (e.g., write-once media and rewritable media) and should discuss the company\u2019s approach to removable media. Ensure the following controls are considered and included in the policy: \u2022 limit the use of removable media to the smallest number needed; and \u2022 scan all removable media for viruses. Example You are in charge of IT operations. You establish a policy for removable media that includes USB drives [a]. The policy information such as: \u2022 only USB drives issued by the organization may be used; and \u2022 USB drives are to be used for work purposes only [a]. You set up a separate computer to scan these drives before anyone uses them on the network. This computer has anti-virus software installed that is kept up to date.

Protections that may be required for transfers or reassignments to other positions within organizations include returning old and issuing new keys, identification cards, and building passes; changing system access authorizations (i.e., privileges); closing system accounts and establishing new accounts; and providing for access to official records to which individuals had access at previous work locations and in previous system accounts. FURTHER DISCUSSION Employee access to CUI is removed when they change jobs or leave the company. When employment or program access is terminated for any reason, the following actions may occur within the defined time frame: \u2022 all company IT equipment (e.g., laptops, cell phones, storage devices) is returned; \u2022 all identification, access cards, and keys are returned; and \u2022 an exit interview is conducted to remind the employee of their obligations to not discuss CUI, even after employment. Additionally, perform the following: \u2022 remove access to all accounts granting access to CUI or modify access to CUI as appropriate for a new work role; \u2022 disable or close employee accounts for departing employees; and \u2022 limit access to physical spaces with CUI for departing employees or those who transition to a work role that does not require access to CUI. This requirement, PS.L2-3.9.2, leverages the identification of system users required by IA.L2- 3.5.1 in order to ensure that all accesses are identified and removed. Example 1 You are in charge of IT operations. Per organizational policies, when workers leave the company, you remove them from any physical CUI access lists. If you are not their supervisor, you contact their supervisor or human resources immediately and ask them to: \u2022 turn in the former employees\u2019 computers for proper handling; PS.L2-3.9.2 \u2013 Personnel Actions CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 179 \u2022 inform help desk or system administrators to have the former employees\u2019 system access revoked; \u2022 retrieve the former employees\u2019 identification and access cards; and \u2022 have the former employees attend an exit interview where you or human resources remind them of their obligations to not discuss CUI [b]. Example 2 An employee transfers from one working group in your company to another. Human resources team notifies IT of the transfer date, and the employee\u2019s new manager follows procedure by submitting a ticket to the IT help desk to provide information on the access rights the employee will require in their new role. IT implements the rights for the new position and revokes the access for the prior position on the official date of the transfer [c]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is information system access disabled upon employee termination or transfer [c]? \u2022 Are authenticators/ credentials associated with the employee revoked upon termination or transfer within a certain time frame [b,c]? \u2022 Is all company information system-related property retrieved from the terminated or transferred employee within a certain timeframe [a,c]? \u2022 Is access to company information and information systems formerly controlled by the terminated or transferred employee retained for a certain timeframe [a,c]? \u2022 Is the information security office and data owner of the change in authorization notified within a certain timeframe [a]?",

Authorized individuals have credentials that include badges, identification cards, and smart cards. Organizations determine the strength of authorization credentials needed consistent with applicable laws, directives, policies, 20 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 46 21 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 32 PE.L1-b.1.viii \u2013 Limit Physical Access [FCI Data] CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 1 | Version 2.13 30 regulations, standards, procedures, and guidelines. This requirement applies only to areas within facilities that have not been designated as publicly accessible. Limiting physical access to equipment may include placing equipment in locked rooms or other secured areas and allowing access to authorized individuals only, and placing equipment in locations that can be monitored by organizational personnel. Computing devices, external disk drives, networking devices, monitors, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines, and audio devices are examples of equipment. FURTHER DISCUSSION This addresses the company\u2019s physical space (e.g., office, testing environments, equipment rooms), technical assets, and non-technical assets that need to be protected from unauthorized physical access. Specific environments are limited to authorized employees, and access is controlled with badges, electronic locks, physical key locks, etc. Output devices, such as printers, are placed in areas where their use does not expose data to unauthorized individuals. Lists of personnel with authorized access are developed and maintained, and personnel are issued appropriate authorization credentials. Example You manage a DoD project that stores FCI on computers used only by project team members [b,c]. You work with the facilities manager to put locks on the doors to the areas where the computers are stored and used [b,c,d]. Project team members are the only individuals issued with keys to the space. This restricts access to only those employees who work on the DoD project and require access. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are lists of personnel with authorized access developed and maintained, and are appropriate authorization credentials issued [a]? \u2022 Has the facility/building manager designated building areas as \u201csensitive\u201d and designed physical security protections (e.g., guards, locks, cameras, card readers) to limit physical access to the area to only authorized employees [b,c,d]? \u2022 Are output devices such as printers placed in areas where their use does not expose data to unauthorized individuals [c]?",

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] Monitoring of physical access includes publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities. This can be accomplished, for example, by the employment of guards; the use of sensor devices; or the use of video surveillance equipment such as cameras. Examples of support infrastructure include system distribution, transmission, and power lines. Security controls applied to the support infrastructure prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering. Such controls may also be necessary to prevent eavesdropping or modification of unencrypted transmissions. Physical access controls to support infrastructure include locked wiring closets; disconnected or locked spare jacks; protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays; and wiretapping sensors. PE.L2-3.10.2 \u2013 Monitor Facility CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 183 FURTHER DISCUSSION The infrastructure inside of a facility, such as power and network cables, is protected so that visitors and unauthorized employees cannot access it. The protection is also monitored by security guards, video cameras, sensors, or alarms. Example You are responsible for protecting your IT facilities. You install video cameras at each entrance and exit, connect them to a video recorder, and show the camera feeds on a display at the reception desk [c,d]. You also make sure there are secure locks on all entrances, exits, and windows to the facilities [a,b].

Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to systems or system components requiring supplemental access controls, or both. System components (e.g., workstations, notebook computers) may be in areas designated as publicly accessible with organizations safeguarding access to such devices. Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, and card readers. FURTHER DISCUSSION Do not allow visitors, even those people you know well, to walk around your facility without an escort. All non-employees should wear special visitor badges and/or are escorted by an employee at all times while on the property. Make sure you have a record of who accesses your facility (e.g., office, plant, factory). You can do this in writing by having employees and visitors sign in and sign out or by electronic means such as badge readers. Whatever means you use, you need to retain the access records for the time period that your company has defined. Identifying and controlling physical access devices (e.g., locks, badges, key cards) is just as important as monitoring and limiting who is able to physically access certain equipment. Physical access devices are only strong protection if you know who has them and what access they allow. Physical access devices can be managed using manual or automatic processes such a list of who is assigned what key, or updating the badge access system as personnel change roles. Example 1 Coming back from a meeting, you see the friend of a coworker walking down the hallway near your office where FCI is stored. You know this person well and trust them, but are not sure why they are in the building. You stop to talk, and the person explains that they are meeting a coworker for lunch, but cannot remember where the lunchroom is. You walk the person back to the reception area to get a visitor badge and wait until someone can escort them to the lunchroom [a]. You report this incident, and the company decides to install a badge reader at the main door so visitors cannot enter without an escort [a]. Example 2 You and your coworkers like to have friends and family join you for lunch at the office on Fridays. Your small company has just signed a contract with the DoD in which your company will receive FCI and you now need to document who enters and leaves your facility. You work with the reception staff to ensure that all non-employees sign in at the reception area and sign out when they leave [c]. You retain those paper sign-in sheets in a locked filing cabinet for one year. Employees receive badges or key cards that enable tracking and logging access to company facilities.

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 1.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]24 Individuals with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered visitors. Audit logs can be used to monitor visitor activity. 22 NIST SP 800-171A, p.47 23 NIST SP 800-171A, pp. 47-48 24 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 32-33 PE.L1-b.1.ix \u2013 Manage Visitors & Physical Access [FCI Data] CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 1 | Version 2.13 32 Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural (e.g., written log of individuals accessing the facility), automated (e.g., capturing ID provided by a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card), or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to systems or system components requiring supplemental access controls, or both. System components (e.g., workstations, notebook computers) may be in areas designated as publicly accessible with organizations safeguarding access to such devices. Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, and card readers. FURTHER DISCUSSION Do not allow visitors, even those people you know well, to walk around your facility without an escort. All non-employees should wear special visitor badges and/or are escorted by an employee at all times while on the property. Make sure you have a record of who accesses your facility (e.g., office, plant, factory). You can do this in writing by having employees and visitors sign in and sign out or by electronic means such as badge readers. Whatever means you use, you need to retain the access records for the time period that your company has defined. Identifying and controlling physical access devices (e.g., locks, badges, key cards) is just as important as monitoring and limiting who is able to physically access certain equipment. Physical access devices are only strong protection if you know who has them and what access they allow. Physical access devices can be managed using manual or automatic processes such a list of who is assigned what key, or updating the badge access system as personnel change roles. Example 1 Coming back from a meeting, you see the friend of a coworker walking down the hallway near your office where FCI is stored. You know this person well and trust them, but are not sure why they are in the building. You stop to talk, and the person explains that they are meeting a coworker for lunch, but cannot remember where the lunchroom is. You walk the person back to the reception area to get a visitor badge and wait until someone can escort them to the lunchroom [a]. You report this incident, and the company decides to install a badge reader at the main door so visitors cannot enter without an escort [a]. Example 2 You and your coworkers like to have friends and family join you for lunch at the office on Fridays. Your small company has just signed a contract with the DoD in which your company will receive FCI and you now need to document who enters and leaves your facility. You work with the reception staff to ensure that all non-employees sign in at the reception area and sign out when they leave [c]. You retain those paper sign-in sheets in a locked filing cabinet for one year. Employees receive badges or key cards that enable tracking and logging access to company facilities. PE.L1-b.1.ix \u2013 Manage Visitors & Physical Access [FCI Data] CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 1 | Version 2.13 33 Example 3 You are a facility manager. A team member retired today and returns their company keys to you. The project on which they were working requires access to areas that contain equipment with FCI. You receive the keys, check your electronic records against the serial numbers on the keys to ensure all have been returned, and mark each key returned [f]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are personnel required to accompany visitors to areas in a facility with physical access to organizational systems [a]? \u2022 Are visitors clearly distinguishable from regular personnel [b]? \u2022 Is visitor activity monitored (e.g., use of cameras or guards, reviews of secure areas upon visitor departure, review of visitor audit logs) [b]? \u2022 Are logs of physical access to sensitive areas (both authorized access and visitor access) maintained per retention requirements [c]? \u2022 Are visitor access records retained for as long as required [c]? \u2022 Are lists or inventories of physical access devices maintained (e.g., keys, facility badges, key cards) [d]? \u2022 Is access to physical access devices limited (e.g., granted to, and accessible only by, authorized individuals) [e]? \u2022 Are physical access devices managed (e.g., revoking key card access when necessary, changing locks as needed, maintaining access control devices and systems) [f]?",

PE.L2-3.10.6 \u2013 Alternative Work Sites CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 191 include physical protections, such as locked file drawers, as well as electronic protections such as encryption, audit logging, and proper access controls. Example Many of your company\u2019s project managers work remotely as they often travel to sponsor locations or even work from home. Because the projects on which they work require access to CUI, you must ensure the same level of protection is afforded as when they work in the office. You ensure that each laptop is deployed with patch management and anti-virus software protection [b]. Because data may be stored on the local hard drive, you have enabled full-disk encryption on their laptops [b]. When a remote staff member needs access to the internal network you require VPN connectivity that also disconnects the laptop from the remote network (i.e., prevents split tunneling) [b]. The VPN requires multifactor authentication to verify remote users are who they claim to be [b].

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 3.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]172 Clearly defined system boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk assessments. Such risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals based on the operation and use of organizational systems. Risk assessments also consider risk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractor operating systems on behalf of the organization, individuals 171 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 49. 172 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 33. RA.L2-3.11.1 \u2013 RIsk Assessments CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 193 accessing organizational systems, outsourcing entities). Risk assessments, either formal or informal, can be conducted at the organization level, the mission or business process level, or the system level, and at any phase in the system development life cycle. NIST SP 800-30 provides guidance on conducting risk assessments. FURTHER DISCUSSION Risk arises from anything that can reduce an organization\u2019s assurance of mission/business success; cause harm to image or reputation; or harm individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. Organizations assess the risk to their operations and assets at regular intervals. Areas where weakness or vulnerabilities could lead to risk may include: \u2022 poorly designed and executed business processes; \u2022 inadvertent actions of people, such as disclosure or modification of information; \u2022 intentional actions of people inside and outside the organization; \u2022 failure of systems to perform as intended; \u2022 failures of technology; and \u2022 external events, such as natural disasters, public infrastructure and supply chain failures. When conducting risk assessments use established criteria and procedures. The results of formal risk assessments are documented. It is important to note that risk assessments differ from vulnerability assessments (see RA.L2-3.11.2). A vulnerability assessment provides input to a risk assessment along with other information such as results from likelihood analysis and analysis of potential treat sources. Risk assessments should be performed at defined regular intervals. Mission risks include anything that will keep an organization from meeting its mission. Function risk is anything that will prevent the performance of a function. Image and reputation risks refer to intangible risks that have value and could cause damage to potential or future trust relationships.173 This requirement, RA.L2-3.11.1, which requires periodically assessing the risk to organization systems, assets, and individuals, is a baseline Risk Assessment requirement. RA.L2-3.11.1 enables other Risk Assessment requirements (e.g., RA.L2-3.11.3, Vulnerability Remediation), as well as CA.L2-3.12.2, Plan of Action. Example You are a system administrator. You and your team members are working on a big government contract requiring you to store CUI. As part of your periodic (e.g., annual) risk assessment exercise, you evaluate the new risk involved with storing CUI [a,b]. When conducting the assessment you consider increased legal exposure, financial requirements of safeguarding CUI, potentially elevated attention from external attackers, and other factors. 173 NIST SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, September 2012. RA.L2-3.11.1 \u2013 RIsk Assessments CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 194 After determining how storing CUI affects your overall risk profile, you use that as a basis for a conversation on how that risk should be mitigated. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Have initial and periodic risk assessments been conducted [b]? \u2022 Are methods defined for assessing risk (e.g., reviewing security assessments, incident reports, and security advisories, identifying threat sources, threat events, and vulnerabilities, and determining likelihood, impact, and overall risk to the confidentiality of CUI) [b]?",

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]175 Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. The vulnerabilities to be scanned are readily updated as new vulnerabilities are discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed. This process ensures that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools (e.g., static analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers). Vulnerability scanning includes: scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using products that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated, scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention, and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of system vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Security assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In certain situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more intrusive or the system component that is the subject of the scanning may contain highly sensitive information. Privileged access authorization to selected system components facilitates thorough vulnerability scanning and protects the sensitive nature of such scanning. NIST SP 800-40 provides guidance on vulnerability management. FURTHER DISCUSSION A vulnerability scanner is an application that identifies vulnerabilities in organizational assets. Most scanners can create a prioritized list of vulnerabilities ordered by their level of severity. Scan for vulnerabilities on all devices connected to the network including servers, desktops, laptops, virtual machines, containers, firewalls, switches, and printers. All assets that are within the scope of the CMMC assessment must be scanned, including assets such as laptop computers that may not routinely connect to an organization\u2019s network. Perform reviews of your organization\u2019s custom-developed software. Vulnerability analysis of a custom-made solution may require a penetration tester to properly test and validate findings. Automated vulnerability scanners may not be as thorough when scanning custom developed applications. Source code scanners can help identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities within code prior to compilation and use. 175 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 33-34. RA.L2-3.11.2 \u2013 Vulnerability Scan CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 197 The vulnerability scanning process is a regular activity, not a single occurrence. Organizations put in place a vulnerability scanner that updates its database each time it performs a scan so it can identify the most current known vulnerabilities. Schedule scans with consideration of the potential for impact to normal operations and use caution when scanning critical assets. This requirement, RA.L2-3.11.2, which ensures scanning for vulnerabilities in organizational systems and application, is a baseline Risk Assessment requirement. RA.L2- 3.11.2, contributes to performing risk assessments as described in RA.L2-3.11.1. Example You are a system administrator. Your organization has assessed its risk and determined that it needs to scan for vulnerabilities in systems and applications once each quarter [a]. You conduct some tests and decide that it is important to be able to schedule scans after standard business hours. You also realize that you have remote workers and that you will need to be sure to scan their remote computers as well [b]. After some final tests, you integrate the scans into normal IT operations, running as scheduled [b,c]. You verify that the scanner application receives the latest updates on vulnerabilities and that those are included in future scans [d,e]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is the frequency specified for vulnerability scans to be performed in organizational systems and applications (e.g., continuous passive scanning, scheduled active scans) [a]? \u2022 Are vulnerability scans performed on a defined frequency or randomly in accordance with company policy [a,b,c]? \u2022 Are systems periodically scanned for common and new vulnerabilities [d,e]? \u2022 Is the list of scanned system vulnerabilities updated on a defined frequency or when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported [d,e]?",

Security controls are the safeguards or countermeasures organizations implement to satisfy security requirements. By assessing the implemented security controls, organizations determine if the security safeguards or countermeasures are in place and operating as intended. Security control assessments ensure that information security is built into organizational systems; identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the development process; provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions; and ensure compliance to vulnerability 178 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 51. 179 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 34-35. CA.L2-3.12.1 \u2013 Security Control Assessment CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 201 mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls as documented in system security plans. Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. Security assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Organizations can choose to use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of systems during the system life cycle. NIST SP 800-53 provides guidance on security and privacy controls for systems and organizations. SP 800-53A provides guidance on developing security assessment plans and conducting assessments. FURTHER DISCUSSION Avoid a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d mentality when implementing security controls. The security landscape is constantly changing. Reassess existing controls at periodic intervals in order to validate their effectiveness in your environment. Set the assessment schedule according to organizational needs. Consider regulatory obligations and internal policies when assessing the controls. Outputs from security control assessments typically include: \u2022 documented assessment results; \u2022 proposed new controls, or updates to existing controls; \u2022 remediation plans; and \u2022 newly identified risks. This requirement, CA.L2-3.12.1, which ensures determining security controls are implemented properly, promotes effective security assessments for organizational systems mandated by CA.L2-3.12.3. Example You are in charge of IT operations. You need to ensure that the security controls implemented within the system are achieving their objectives [b]. Taking the requirements outlined in your SSP as a guide, you conduct annual written reviews of the security controls to ensure they meet your organization\u2019s needs. When you find controls that do not meet requirements, you propose updated or new controls, develop a written implementation plan, document new risks, and execute the changes.

Organizations develop plans of action that describe how any unimplemented security requirements will be met and how any planned mitigations will be implemented. Organizations can document the system security plan and plan of action as separate or combined documents and in any chosen format. Federal agencies may consider the submitted system security plans and plans of action as critical inputs to an overall risk management decision to process, store, or transmit CUI on a system hosted by a nonfederal organization and whether it is advisable to pursue an agreement or contract with the nonfederal organization. 180 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 51. 181 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 35. CA.L2-3.12.2 \u2013 operational Plan of Action CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 204 FURTHER DISCUSSION When you write a plan of action, define the clear goal or objective of the plan. You may include the following in the action plan: \u2022 ownership of who is accountable for ensuring the plan\u2019s performance; \u2022 specific steps or milestones that are clear and actionable; \u2022 assigned responsibility for each step or milestone; \u2022 milestones to measure plan progress; and \u2022 completion dates. This requirement, CA.L2-3.12.2, which ensures developing and implementing operational plans of action to correct and reduce vulnerabilities in systems, is driven by risk management requirement RA.L2-3.11.1, which promotes periodically assessing risk to organizational systems. CA.L2-3.12.2 promotes monitoring security controls on an ongoing basis as defined in requirement CA.L2-3.12.3. An operational plan of action in accordance with CA.L2-3.12.2 differs from a CMMC assessment POA&M as described in 32 CFR \u00a7 170.21. The assessment POA&M places conditions on which security requirements can be assessed as NOT MET and allows the OSA to qualify for a CMMC Status of Conditional Level 2 (Self), Conditional Level 2 (C3PAO), or Conditional Level 3 (DIBCAC). Operational plans of action are not subject to the 180 day POA&M closeout requirement. Severity, availability of remediation, and business requirements are among the factors to consider when creating and maintaining operational plans of action. Example As IT director, one of your duties is to develop action plans when you discover that your company is not meeting security requirements or when a security issue arises [b]. A recent vulnerability scan identified several items that need to be addressed so you develop a plan to fix them [b]. Your plan identifies the people responsible for fixing the issues, how to do it, and when the remediation will be completed [b]. You also define how to verify that the person responsible has fixed the vulnerability [b]. You document this in an operational plan of action that is updated as milestones are reached [b]. You have a separate resource review the modifications after they have been completed to ensure the plan has been implemented correctly [c]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is there an action plan to remediate identified weaknesses or deficiencies [a]? \u2022 Is the action plan maintained as remediation is performed [b]? \u2022 Does the action plan designate remediation dates and milestones for each item [c]?

Assessment objective (3.12.3): Determine if security controls are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued effectiveness of those controls.. POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]183 Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats, vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess and analyze security controls and information security-related risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. The results of continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response actions by organizations. Providing access to security information on a continuing basis through reports or dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make effective and timely risk management decisions. Automation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, firmware inventories, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely. Monitoring 182 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 52. 183 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 35. CA.L2-3.12.3 \u2013 Security Control Monitoring CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 207 requirements, including the need for specific monitoring, may also be referenced in other requirements. NIST SP 800-137 provides guidance on continuous monitoring. FURTHER DISCUSSION Provide a plan for monitoring the state of security controls on a recurring basis that occurs more frequently than the periodic assessments discussed in CA.L2-3.12.1. This process provides a mechanism to assess the overall security posture of your organization, which directly relates to activities discussed in CA.L2-3.12.4. As a result, the process not only maintains awareness of vulnerabilities and threats, but it also informs management of the effectiveness of the security controls in determining if security controls are current and for management to make an acceptable risk decision. Example You are responsible for ensuring your company fulfills all cybersecurity requirements for its DoD contracts. You review those requirements and the security controls your company has put in place to meet them. You then create a plan to evaluate each control regularly over the next year. You mark several controls to be evaluated by a third-party security assessor. You assign other IT resources in the organization to evaluate controls within their area of responsibility. To ensure progress you establish recurring meetings with the accountable IT staff to assess continuous monitoring progress, review security information, evaluate risks from gaps in continuous monitoring, and produce reports for your management [a]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are the security controls that need to be continuously monitored identified [a]? \u2022 Is the timeframe for continuous monitoring activities to support risk-based decision making defined [a]? \u2022 Is the output of continuous monitoring activities provided to stakeholders [a]?",

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 0.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]185 System security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls. System security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls meet those security requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls. System security plans contain sufficient information to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk if the plan is implemented as intended. Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of various documents including documents that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications) where more detailed information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs and maintains security-related information in other established management/operational areas related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. Federal agencies may consider the submitted system security plans and plans of action as critical inputs to an overall risk management decision to process, store, or transmit CUI on a system hosted by a nonfederal organization and whether it is advisable to pursue an agreement or contract with the nonfederal organization. NIST SP 800-18 provides guidance on developing security plans. FURTHER DISCUSSION A system security plan (SSP) is a document that outlines how an organization implements its security requirements. OSAs must have an SSP in place at the time of assessment to describe each information system within the CMMC Assessment Scope. The absence of an up-to-date SSP at the time of the assessment would result in a finding that an assessment could not be completed due to incomplete information and noncompliance with DFARS clause 252.204-7012. OSAs are free to choose the format of their SSP. At a minimum, an SSP must include: \u2022 Description of the CMMC Assessment Scope; \u2022 CMMC Assessment Scope Description: high-level description of the assets within the assessment scope186; \u2022 Description of the Environment of Operation: physical surroundings in which an information system processes, stores, and transmits information; \u2022 Identified and Approved Security Requirements: requirements levied on an information system that are derived from applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, instructions, regulations, procedures, or organizational mission/business case needs to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted; 185 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 35-36. 186 There is no requirement to embed every asset in the SSP. . CA.L2-3.12.4 \u2013 System Security Plan CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 210 \u2022 Implementation Method for Security Requirements: description of how the identified and approved security requirements are implemented with the system or environment; \u2022 Connections and Relationships to Other Systems and Networks: description of related, dependent, and interconnected systems; and \u2022 Defined Frequency of Updates: at least annually. In addition to the requirements above, an SSP often includes: \u2022 general information system description: technical and functional description; \u2022 design philosophies: defense-in-depth strategies and allowed interfaces and network protocols; and \u2022 roles and responsibilities: description of the roles and responsibilities for key personnel, which may include the system owner, system custodian, authorizing officials, and other stakeholders This requirement, CA.L2-3.12.4, which requires developing, documenting, and updating system security plans, promotes effective information security within organizational systems required by SC.L2-3.13.2, as well as other system and communications protection requirements. Example You are in charge of system security. You develop an SSP and have senior leadership formally approve the document [a]. The SSP explains how your organization handles CUI and defines how that data is stored, transmitted, and protected [d,e]. The criteria outlined in the SSP is used to guide configuration of the network and other information resources to meet your company\u2019s goals. Knowing that it is important to keep the SSP current, you establish a policy that requires a formal review and update of the SSP each year [g,h]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Do mechanisms exist to develop and periodically update an SSP [a,g]? \u2022 Are security requirements identified and approved by the designated authority as non-applicable documented [d]?",

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]26 Communications can be monitored, controlled, and protected at boundary components and by restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems. Boundary components include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a system security architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on protected subnetworks). Restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems includes restricting external web communications traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses. Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of security requirements associated with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers and may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. NIST SP 800-41 provides guidance on firewalls and firewall policy. NIST SP 800-125B provides guidance on security for virtualization technologies. FURTHER DISCUSSION Fences, locks, badges, and key cards help keep non-employees out of your physical facilities. Similarly, your company\u2019s IT network or system has boundaries that must be protected. Many companies use a web proxy and a firewall. When an employee uses a company computer to go to a website, a web proxy makes the request on the user\u2019s behalf, looks at the web request, and decides if it should let the employee go to the website. A firewall controls access from the inside and outside, protecting valuable information and resources stored on the company\u2019s network. A firewall stops unwanted traffic on the internet from passing through an outside \u201cfence\u201d to the company\u2019s networks and information systems. Internal boundaries determine where data can flow, for instance a software development environment may have its own boundary controlling, monitoring, and protecting the data that can leave that boundary. It may be wise to monitor, control, or protect one part of the company network from another. This can also be accomplished with a firewall and limits the ability of attackers and disgruntled employees from entering sensitive parts of your internal network and causing damage. Example You are setting up the new network with an FCI enclave. You start by sketching out a simple diagram that identifies the external boundary of your network and any internal boundaries that are needed [a,b]. The first piece of equipment you install is the firewall, a device to 26 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 36 SC.L1-b.1.x \u2013 Boundary Protection [FCI Data] CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 1 | Version 2.13 36 separate your internal network from the internet. The firewall also has a feature that allows you to block access to potentially malicious websites, and you configure that service as well [a,c,e,g]. Some of your coworkers complain that they cannot get to certain websites [c,e,g]. You explain that the new network blocks websites that are known for spreading malware. The firewall sends you a daily digest of blocked activity so that you can monitor the system for attack trends [c,d]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 What are the external system boundary components that make up the entry and exit points for data flow (e.g., firewalls, gateways, cloud service boundaries), behind which all system components that handle regulated data are contained? What are the supporting system components necessary for the protection of regulated data [a]? \u2022 What are the internal system boundary components that make up the entry and exit points for key internal data flow (e.g., internal firewalls, routers, any devices that can bridge the connection between one segment of the system and another) that separate segments of the internal network \u2013 including devices that separate internal network segments such as development and production networks as well as a traditional DMZ at the edge of the network [b]? \u2022 Is data flowing in and out of the external and key internal system boundaries monitored (e.g., connections are logged and able to be reviewed, suspicious traffic generates alerts) [c,d]? \u2022 Is data traversing the external and internal system boundaries controlled such that connections are denied by default and only authorized connections are allowed [e,f]? \u2022 Is data flowing in and out of the external and key internal system boundaries protected (e.g., applying encryption when required or prudent, tunneling traffic as needed) [g,h]?",

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]190 Organizations apply systems security engineering principles to new development systems or systems undergoing major upgrades. For legacy systems, organizations apply systems security engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems. The application of systems security engineering concepts and principles helps to develop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and system components and reduce the susceptibility of organizations to disruptions, hazards, and threats. Examples of these concepts and principles include developing layered protections; establishing security policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design; incorporating security requirements into the system development life cycle; delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how to build secure software; and performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk. Organizations that apply security engineering concepts and principles can facilitate the development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system services; reduce risk to acceptable levels; and make informed risk-management decisions. NIST SP 800-160-1 provides guidance on systems security engineering. FURTHER DISCUSSION Familiarity with security engineering principles and their successful application to your infrastructure will increase the security of your environment. NIST SP 800-160 System Security Engineering: Considerations for a Multidisciplinary Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems can serve as a source of security engineering and design principles. Decide which designs and principles to apply. Some will not be possible or appropriate for a given company or for specific systems or components. Designs and principles should be applied to policies and security standards. Starting with the baseline configuration, they should be extended through all layers of the technology stack (e.g., hardware, software, firmware) and throughout all the components of the infrastructure. The application of these chosen designs and principles should drive you 190 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 36-37. SC.L2-3.13.2 \u2013 Security Engineering CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 216 towards a secure architecture with the required security capabilities and intrinsic behaviors present throughout the lifecycle of your technology. As legacy components age, it may become increasingly difficult for those components to meet security principles and requirements. This should factor into life-cycle decisions for those components (e.g., replacing legacy hardware, upgrading or re-writing software, upgrading run-time environments). Example You are responsible for developing strategies to protect data and harden your infrastructure. You are on a team responsible for performing a major upgrade to a legacy system. You refer to your documented security engineering principles [c]. Reviewing each, you decide which are appropriate and applicable [c]. You apply the chosen designs and principles when creating your design for the upgrade [f]. You document the security requirements for the software and hardware changes to ensure the principles are followed. You review the upgrade at critical points in the workflow to ensure the requirements are met. You assist in updating the policies covering the use of the upgraded system so user behavior stays aligned with the principles. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Does the organization have a defined system architecture [a,d]? \u2022 Are system security engineering principles applied in the specification, design, development and implementation of the systems [d,e,f]?",

SPRS score: 1.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]192 System management functionality includes functions necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires privileged user access. The separation of user functionality from system management functionality is physical or logical. Organizations can implement separation of system management functionality from user functionality by using different computers, different central processing units, different instances of operating systems, or different network addresses; virtualization techniques; or combinations of these or other methods, as appropriate. This type of separation includes web administrative interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other system resources. Separation of system and user functionality may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains and with additional access controls. 191 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 54. 192 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 37. SC.L2-3.13.3 \u2013 Role Separation CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 218 FURTHER DISCUSSION Prevent users and user services from accessing system management functionality on IT components (e.g., databases, network components, workstations, servers). This reduces the attack surface to those critical interfaces by limiting who can access and how they can be accessed. By separating the user functionality from system management functionality, the administrator or privileged functions are not available to the general user. The intent of this requirement is to ensure: \u2022 general users are not permitted to perform system administration functions; and \u2022 system administrators only perform system administration functions from their privileged account. This can be accomplished using separation like VLANs or logical separation using strong access control methods. Example As a system administrator, you are responsible for managing a number of core systems. Policy prevents you from conducting any administration from the computer or system account you use for day-to-day work [a,b]. The servers you manage also are isolated from the main corporate network. To work with them you use a special unique account to connect to a \u201cjump\u201d server that has access to the systems you routinely administer. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are physical or logical controls used to separate user functionality from system management-related functionality (e.g., to ensure that administration (e.g., privilege) options are not available to general users) [c]?",

SPRS score: 1.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]194 The control of information in shared system resources (e.g., registers, cache memory, main memory, hard disks) is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection. This requirement prevents information produced by the actions of prior users or roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users or roles) from being available to any current users or roles (or current processes acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access to shared system resources after those resources have been released back to the system. This requirement also applies to encrypted representations of information. This requirement does not address information remnants, which refers to residual representation of data that has been nominally deleted; covert channels (including storage or timing channels) where shared resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or components within systems for which there are only single users or roles. 193 NIST SP 800-171A, pp. 54-55. 194 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 37. SC.L2-3.13.4 \u2013 Shared Resource Control CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 220 FURTHER DISCUSSION No shared system resource, such as cache memory, hard disks, registers, or main memory may pass information from one user to another user. In other words, when objects are reused no residual information should exist on that object. This protects the confidentiality of the information. This is typically a feature provided by operating system and software vendors. Example You are a system administrator responsible for creating and deploying the system hardening procedures for your company\u2019s computers. You ensure that the computer baselines include software patches to prevent attackers from exploiting flaws in the processor architecture to read data (e.g., the Meltdown and Spectre exploits).

DMZs are typically implemented with boundary control devices and techniques that include routers, gateways, firewalls, virtualization, or cloud- based technologies. NIST SP 800-41 provides guidance on firewalls and firewall policy. SP 800-125B provides guidance on security for virtualization technologies. 27 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 55 28 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 37-38 SC.L1-b.1.xi \u2013 Public-Access System Separation [FCI Data] CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 1 | Version 2.13 38 FURTHER DISCUSSION Publicly accessible systems should be separated from the internal systems that need to be protected. Internal systems should not be placed on the same network as publicly accessible systems, and access by default from DMZ networks to internal networks should be blocked. One method of accomplishing this is to create a DMZ network, which enhances security by providing public access to a specific set of resources while preventing connections from those resources to the rest of the IT environment. Some OSAs may achieve a similar result through the use of a cloud computing environment that is separated from the rest of the company\u2019s infrastructure. Example The head of recruiting at your firm wants to launch a website to post job openings and allow the public to download an application form [a].

In doing so, it adds specifics for SC.L2-3.13.1, which only requires monitoring, control, and protection of communication channels. Example You are setting up a new environment to house CUI. To properly isolate the CUI network, you install a firewall between it and other networks and set the firewall rules to deny all traffic [a]. You review each service and application that runs in the new environment and determine that you only need to allow http and https traffic outbound [b].

However, split tunneling allows unauthorized external connections, making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information. This requirement is implemented in remote devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, and tablets) through configuration settings to disable split tunneling in those devices, and by preventing configuration settings from being readily configurable by users. This requirement is implemented in the system by the detection of split tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. 199 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 56. 200 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 38. SC.L2-3.13.7 \u2013 Split Tunneling CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 226 FURTHER DISCUSSION Split tunneling for a remote user utilizes two connections: accessing resources on the internal network via a VPN and simultaneously accessing an external network such as a public network or the internet. Split tunneling presents a potential opportunity where an open unencrypted connection from a public network could allow an adversary to access resources on internal network. As a mitigation strategy, the split tunneling setting should be disabled on all devices so that all traffic, including traffic for external networks or the internet, goes through the VPN. Example You are a system administrator responsible for configuring the network to prevent remote users from using split tunneling. You review the configuration of remote user laptops. You discover that remote users are able to access files, email, database and other services through the VPN connection while also being able to print and access resources on their local network. You change the configuration settings for all company computers to disable split tunneling [a]. You test a laptop that has had the new hardening procedures applied and verify that all traffic from the laptop is now routed through the VPN connection.

Communication paths outside the physical protection of controlled boundaries are susceptible to both interception and modification. Organizations relying on commercial providers offering transmission services as commodity services rather than as fully dedicated services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to individual customer needs), may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of the controls for transmission 201 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 56. 202 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 38. SC.L2-3.13.8 \u2013 Data in Transit CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 228 confidentiality. In such situations, organizations determine what types of confidentiality services are available in commercial telecommunication service packages. If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary safeguards and assurances of the effectiveness of the safeguards through appropriate contracting vehicles, organizations implement compensating safeguards or explicitly accept the additional risk. An example of an alternative physical safeguard is a protected distribution system (PDS) where the distribution medium is protected against electronic or physical intercept, thereby ensuring the confidentiality of the information being transmitted. FURTHER DISCUSSION The intent of this requirement is to ensure CUI is cryptographically protected during transit, particularly on the internet. The most common way to accomplish this is to establish a TLS tunnel between the source and destination using the most current version of TLS. This requirement does not specify a mutually authenticated handshake, but mutual authentication is the most secure approach to creating a tunnel. Because the use of cryptography in this requirement is to protect the confidentiality of CUI, the cryptography used must meet the criteria specified in requirement SC.L2-3.13.11. This requirement, SC.L2-3.13.8, requires cryptographic mechanisms be used to prevent the disclosure of CUI in-transit and leverages SC.L2-3.13.11, which specifies that the algorithms used must be FIPS-validated cryptography. Example You are a system administrator responsible for configuring encryption on all devices that contain CUI. Because your users regularly store CUI on laptops and take them out of the office, you encrypt the hard drives with a FIPS-validated encryption tool built into the operating system. For users who need to share CUI, you install a Secure FTP server to allow CUI to be transmitted in a compliant manner [a]. You verify that the server is using a FIPS- validated encryption module by checking the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program website [c]. You turn on the \u201cFIPS Compliance\u201d setting for the server during configuration because that is what is required for this product in order to use only FIPS- validated cryptography [c]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are cryptographic mechanisms used to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information during transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical measures (e.g., PDS) [c]?",

Organizations define key management requirements in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, and standards specifying appropriate options, levels, and parameters. NIST SP 800-56A and NIST SP 800-57-1 provide guidance on cryptographic key management and key establishment. FURTHER DISCUSSION Develop processes and technical mechanisms to protect the cryptographic keys\u2019 confidentiality, authenticity, and authorized use in accordance with industry standards and 205 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 57. 206 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 39. SC.L2-3.13.10 \u2013 Key Management CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 232 regulations. Key management systems provide oversight, assurance, and the capability to demonstrate the cryptographic keys are created in a secure manner and protected from loss or misuse throughout their lifecycle (e.g., active, expired, revoked). For a small number of keys, this can be accomplished with manual procedures and mechanisms. As the number of keys and cryptographic units increase, automation and tool support will be required. The first intent of this requirement is to ensure cryptographic keys are properly created in a secure manner that prevents them from being reproduced by an adversary. The second intent of this requirement is to ensure cryptographic keys are managed in a secure manner that prevents them from being stolen by an adversary. Key establishment involves the creation of keys and coordination among parties that will use the keys of the methodology for generating the final keying material. This is discussed in detail in SP 800-56A, B, and C. Key management involves protecting keys when they are distributed, when they are stored, when they are being used, and when they are being recovered. Key establishment best practices are identified in NIST SP 800-56A, B, and C. Key management best practices are identified in NIST SP 800-57 Parts 1, 2, and 3. This requirement, SC.L2-3.13.10, complements AC.L2-3.1.19 by specifying that any cryptographic keys in use must be protected. Example 1 You are a system administrator responsible for providing key management. You have generated a public-private key pair to exchange CUI [a]. You require all system administrators to read the key management policy before you allow them to install the private key on their machines [b]. No one else is allowed to know or have a copy of the private key per the policy. You provide the public key to the other parties who will be sending you CUI and test the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to ensure the encryption is working [a]. You set a revocation period of one year on all your certificates per organizational policy [b]. Example 2 You encrypt all of your company\u2019s computers using the disk encryption utility built into the operating system. As you configure encryption on each device, it generates a cryptographic key. You associate each key with the correct computer in your inventory spreadsheet and restrict access to the spreadsheet to the system administrators whose work role requires them to manage the computers [b].

SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]208 Cryptography can be employed to support many security solutions including the protection of controlled unclassified information, the provision of digital signatures, and the enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary clearances for such information but lack the necessary formal access approvals. Cryptography can also be used to support random number generation and hash generation. Cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and/or NSA-approved cryptography. FURTHER DISCUSSION FIPS-validated cryptography means the cryptographic module has to have been tested and validated to meet FIPS 140-2 requirements. Simply using an approved algorithm is not sufficient \u2013 the module (software and/or hardware) used to implement the algorithm must be separately validated under FIPS 140. Accordingly, FIPS-validated cryptography is 207 NIST SP 800-171A, pp. 57-58. 208 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 39. SC.L2-3.13.11 \u2013 CUI Encryption CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 235 required to protect CUI when transmitted or stored outside the protected environment of the covered OSA information system (including wireless/remote access). Encryption used for other purposes, such as within applications or devices within the protected environment of the covered OSA information system, would not need to use FIPS-validated cryptography. This requirement, SC.L2-3.13.11, complements AC.L2-3.1.19, MP.L2-3.8.6, SC.L2-3.13.8, and SC.L2-3.13.16 by specifying that FIPS-validated cryptography must be used. While FIPS- validated modules and algorithms are critical for protecting CUI, in limited cases Enduring Exceptions and temporary deficiencies may apply when implementing such cryptographic mechanisms. Example You are a system administrator responsible for deploying encryption on all devices that contain CUI. You must ensure that the encryption you use on the devices is FIPS-validated cryptography [a]. An employee informs you of a need to carry a large volume of CUI offsite and asks for guidance on how to do so. You provide the user with disk encryption software that you have verified via the NIST website that uses a CMVP-validated encryption module [a]. Once the encryption software is active, the user copies the CUI data onto the drive for transport. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is cryptography implemented to protect the confidentiality of CUI at rest and in transit, through the configuration of systems and applications or through the use of encryption tools [a]?",

In contrast, other telephone services are based on high-speed, digital communications lines, such as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI). The main distinctions between POTS and non-POTS services are speed and bandwidth. To address the threats associated with VoIP, usage restrictions and implementation guidelines are based on the potential for the VoIP technology to cause damage to the system if it is used maliciously. Threats to VoIP are similar to those inherent with any Internet-based application. NIST SP 800-58 provides guidance on Voice Over IP Systems. 213 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 59. 214 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 40.

Monitoring should include the users\u2019 activity for anything other than what is permitted and authorized and detection of insecure or unauthorized use of the VoIP technology. Security concerns for VoIP include eavesdropping on calls and using ID spoofing to impersonate trusted individuals. Selecting a solution that can encrypt VoIP traffic is helpful in maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the voice data.

You require phone system administrators to log in using multifactor authentication when managing the system [a]. You add the VoIP software to the list of applications that are patched monthly as needed [a,b]. Finally, you configure the VoIP system to send logs to your log aggregator so that they can be correlated with those from other systems and examined for signs of suspicious activity [b].

Security requirement: Protect the confidentiality of CUI at rest.. Assessment objective (3.13.16): Determine if the confidentiality of CUI at rest is protected.. POA&M allowed: Yes. SPRS score: 1.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]218 Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is not in process or in transit and is located on storage devices as specific components of systems. The focus of protection at rest is not on the type of storage device or the frequency of access but rather the state of the information. Organizations can use different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality protections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Organizations may also use other controls including secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved or continuous monitoring to identify malicious code at rest. FURTHER DISCUSSION CUI at rest means information that is not moving through the network; typically this means data currently stored on hard drives, media, and mobile devices. Implement the necessary security controls to protect the confidentiality of CUI at rest. Although an approved 217 NIST SP 800-171A, pp. 59-60. 218 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 40. SC.L2-3.13.16 \u2013 Data at Rest CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 245 encryption method protects data stored at rest, there are other technical and physical solutions. The methods chosen should depend on the environment and business needs. Implementing encryption for CUI is one approach to this requirement, but it is not mandatory. Physical security is often employed to restrict access to CUI, particularly when it resides on servers within a company\u2019s offices. Other approaches for protecting CUI include system-related protections such as configurations and rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content that eliminate attempts at exfiltration. You may also employ other security requirements including secure off-line storage. Because the use of cryptography in this requirement is to protect the confidentiality of CUI, the cryptography used must meet the criteria specified in requirement SC.L2-3.13.11. This requirement, SC.L2-3.13.16, specifies confidentially be provided for CUI at rest and complements MP.L2-3.8.9, which specifies confidentially of CUI at backup storage locations. This requirement, SC.L2-3.13.16, also leverages SC.L2-3.13.11, which specifies that the algorithms used must be FIPS-validated cryptography. Example 1 Your company has a policy stating CUI must be protected at rest and you work to enforce that policy. You research Full Disk Encryption (FDE) products that meet the FIPS encryption requirement. After testing, you deploy the encryption to all computers to protect CUI at rest [a]. Example 2 You have used encryption to protect the CUI on most of the computers at your company, but you have some devices that do not support encryption. You create a policy requiring these devices to be signed out when needed, stay in possession of the signer when checked out, and to be signed back in and locked up in a secured closet when the user is done with the device [a]. At the end of the day each Friday, you audit the sign-out sheet and make sure all devices are returned to the closet. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is the confidentiality of CUI at rest protected using encryption of storage devices and/or appropriate physical methods [a]?",

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]30 Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws and report this information to designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. Organizations can take advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database in remediating flaws discovered in organizational systems. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of factors including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types of remediation. NIST SP 800-40 provides guidance on patch management technologies. FURTHER DISCUSSION All software and firmware have potential flaws. Many vendors work to remedy those flaws by releasing vulnerability information and updates to their software and firmware. OSAs should have a process to review relevant vendor notifications and updates about problems or weaknesses. After reviewing the information, the OSA should implement a patch management process that allows for software and firmware flaws to be fixed without adversely affecting the system functionality. OSAs should define the time frames within which flaws are identified, reported, and corrected for all systems. Example You know that software vendors typically release patches, service packs, hot fixes, etc. and want to make sure your software that processes FCI is up to date. You develop a policy that requires checking vendor websites for flaw notifications every week [a]. The policy further requires that those flaws be assessed for severity and patched on end-user computers once each week and servers once each month [c,e]. Consistent with that policy, you configure the system to check for updates weekly or daily depending on the criticality of the software [b,e]. Your team reviews available updates and implements the applicable ones according to the defined schedule [f]. 30 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 40-41 SI.L1-b.1.xii \u2013 Flaw Remediation [FCI Data] CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 1 | Version 2.13 41 Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Is the time frame (e.g., a set number of days) within which system flaw identification activities (e.g., vulnerability scans, configuration scans, manual review) must be performed defined and documented [a]? \u2022 Are system flaws (e.g., vulnerabilities, misconfigurations) identified in accordance with the specified time frame [b]? \u2022 Is the time frame (e.g., a set number of days dependent on the assessed severity of a flaw) within which system flaws must be corrected defined and documented [e]? \u2022 Are system flaws (e.g., applied security patches, made configuration changes, or implemented workarounds or mitigations) corrected within the specified time frame [f]?",

Malicious code includes viruses, worms, 31 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 61 32 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 61-62 33 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 41 SI.L1-b.1.xiii \u2013 Malicious Code ProTection [FCI Data] CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 1 | Version 2.13 43 Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways including web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. NIST SP 800-83 provides guidance on malware incident prevention. FURTHER DISCUSSION Malicious code purposely performs unauthorized activity that undermines the security of an information system. A designated location may be a network device such as a firewall or an end user\u2019s computer. Malicious code, which can be delivered by a range of means (e.g., email, removable media, or websites), includes the following: \u2022 Virus \u2013 program designed to cause damage, steal information, change data, send email, show messages, or any combination of these things; \u2022 Spyware \u2013 program designed to secretly gather information about a person\u2019s activity; \u2022 Trojan Horse \u2013 type of malware made to look like legitimate software and used by cyber criminals to get access to a company\u2019s systems; and \u2022 Ransomware \u2013 type of malware that threatens to publish the victim\u2019s data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. Consider use of anti-malware tools to stop or lessen the impact of malicious code. Example Your company\u2019s IT team is buying new computers and wants to protect your company\u2019s information from viruses and spyware. The computers will be used to process, store, and transmit FCI. They research anti-malware products, select an appropriate solution, and deploy antivirus software on all hosts for which satisfactory antivirus software is available [a,b].

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]224 There are many publicly available sources of system security alerts and advisories. The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) generates security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the federal government and in nonfederal organizations. Software vendors, subscription services, and relevant industry information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) may also provide security alerts and advisories. Examples of response actions include notifying relevant external organizations, 223 NIST SP 800-171A, p. 62. 224 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, p. 41. SI.L2-3.14.3 \u2013 Security Alerts & Advisories CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 253 for example, external mission/business partners, supply chain partners, external service providers, and peer or supporting organizations. NIST SP 800-161 provides guidance on supply chain risk management. FURTHER DISCUSSION Solicit and receive security alerts, advisories, and directives from reputable external organizations. Identify sources relevant to the industry and technology used by your company. Methods to receive alerts and advisories may include: \u2022 signing up for email distributions; \u2022 subscribing to RSS feeds; and \u2022 attending meetings. Review alerts and advisories for applicability as they are received. The frequency of the reviews should be based on the frequency of the alerts and advisories to ensure you have the most up-to-date information. External alerts and advisories may prompt you to generate internal security alerts, advisories, or directives, and share these with all personnel with a need-to-know. The individuals should assess the risk related to a given alert and act to respond as appropriate. Sometimes it may require a configuration update. Other times, the information may also require adjusting system architecture in order to thwart a threat described in an advisory. Example You monitor security advisories each week. You review the alert emails and online subscription service alerts to determine which ones apply [b]. You create a list of the applicable alerts and research what steps you need to take to address them. Next, you generate a plan that you review with your change management group so that the work can be scheduled [c]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are the responses to system security alerts and advisories identified in relation to the assessed severity of potential flaws (e.g., communicating with responsible personnel, initiating vulnerability scans, initiating system flaw remediation activities) [a]? \u2022 Are system security alerts and advisories addressed (e.g., assessing potential severity or likelihood, communicating with responsible personnel, initiating vulnerability scans, initiating system flaw remediation activities) [a,c]?",

POA&M allowed: No. SPRS score: 5.\n\nDISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]230 System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations can monitor systems, for example, by observing audit record activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events. System monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices being employed at managed system interfaces. The granularity of monitoring information collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives. System monitoring is an integral part of continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be either wired or wireless. Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound/outbound communications traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code in systems or propagating among system components, the unauthorized exporting of information, or signaling to external systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify potentially compromised systems or system components. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other requirements. NIST SP 800-94 provides guidance on intrusion detection and prevention systems. FURTHER DISCUSSION Think of indicators of attack as a set of footprints an adversary leaves during an attack. Indicators of attack provide information on the steps the adversary followed and its intent. Indicators of attacks on organizational systems may include: \u2022 internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code; \u2022 anomalous activity detected during non-business hours; \u2022 unauthorized data leaving the organization; and \u2022 communicating to external information systems. 230 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, pp. 42-43. SI.L2-3.14.6 \u2013 Monitor Communications for Attacks CMMC Assessment Guide \u2013 Level 2 | Version 2.13 260 To detect attacks and indicators of attacks, deploy monitoring devices or agents. Place these sensors at strategic points within the systems and networks to collect essential information. Strategic points include internal and external system boundaries. Monitor both inbound traffic and outbound traffic as well as actions on hosts. This requirement, SI.L2-3.14.6, provides details for the communications of organizational systems. SI.L2-3.14.6 supports the requirement AU.L2-3.3.1, which involves creating and retaining records for monitoring, analysis, and investigations. Example It is your job to look for known indicators of attack or anomalous activity within your systems and communications traffic [a,b,c]. Because these indicators can show up in a variety of places on your network, you have created a checklist of places to check each week. These include the office firewall logs, the audit logs of the file server where CUI is stored, and the connection log for your VPN gateway [b]. You conduct additional reviews when you find an indicator, or something that does not perform as it should [a]. Potential Assessment Considerations \u2022 Are details provided for the methodology of determining attacks and indicators of attack [a]? \u2022 Are monitoring devices deployed within the information system to collect information that may indicate an attack [a]? \u2022 Are communications traffic flows understood and is there a deployed capability to review that traffic [b,c]?",

System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other requirements. NIST SP 800-94 provides guidance on intrusion detection and prevention systems. FURTHER DISCUSSION Define authorized use of your systems. Create an acceptable use policy to establish the baseline for how users access devices, internal network services, and the internet. Define authorized use by specific roles such as: user, administrator, and technician. After authorized use is defined, identify unauthorized use of systems. Monitor systems by observing audit activities from the system logs. This can be accomplished in real time using automated solutions or by manual means. To identify unauthorized use, leverage existing tools and techniques, such as: \u2022 intrusion detection systems; \u2022 intrusion prevention systems; \u2022 malicious code protection software; \u2022 scanning tools; \u2022 audit record monitoring software; and \u2022 network monitoring software. This requirement, SI.L2-3.14.7, which deals with identifying unauthorized use of organizational systems, is related to requirements: AC.L2-3.1.1, AU.L2-3.3.1, IA.L2-3.5.1, and IA.L2-3.5.2. All of these requirements help create the building blocks that support SI.L2-3.14.7. Example 1 You are in charge of IT operations. You need to ensure that everyone using an organizational system is authorized to do so and conforms to the written authorized use policy. To do this, you deploy an application that monitors user activity and records the information for later analysis. You review the data from this application for signs of activity that does not conform to the acceptable use policy [a,b]. Example 2 You are alerted through your Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that one of your users is connecting to a server that is from a high-risk domain (based on your commercial domain reputation service). You investigate and determine that it\u2019s not the user, but instead an unauthorized connection attempt [b]. You add the domain to your list of blocked domains to prevent connections in the future.
